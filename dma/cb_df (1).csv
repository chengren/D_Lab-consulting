The new logo is meant to be 'a modern redesign that's more reflective of [Yahoo's] reimagined design and new experiences.'\n\nWhat's in a logo?\n\nSome instantly recognizable logos, such as Tide or Hershey's, reassure consumers that they can trust the product they are buying; however other logos, such as BP or United Airlines, are often associated with poor company performance and PR disasters that can deter brand loyalty.\n\n Recently, we've seen a shift in popular design as branding moves beyond print and packaging to web and mobile. These new platforms are much more diverse in presentation than grocery store shelves, highway billboards, and 8.5 x 11 inch magazine pages, and therefore require brand design to be responsive and flexible.\n\n Many old logos have not adjusted well to these new mediums and sit awkwardly in app icons and mobile browsers, much like your grandmother's Victorian-era chair would look in Ironman's swanky modern digs. Instead of inspiring consumer loyalty, an old company logo gives becomes pass\xc3\xa9, unaware of change, and out of place in our increasingly technology-centric society.\n\n However, with change often comes backlash, especially if the reasons are unclear. Many logo redesigns receive mixed or even unfavorable reactions from the public, and sometimes it's so extreme that they are pulled just after launch. Gap and Tropicana are two such examples - both companies received so many negative reactions to an attempted rebrand that they reverted back to old logos in a matter of days.\n\n Since a new logo is sometimes necessary for a company to move forward, how can it successfully strike a balance between loyalty and innovation?\xc2\xa0The answer is in the public eye. And while the public is notoriously fickle about change, Yahoo may have the answer.\n\n Yahoo's '30 Days' campaign introduced the idea slowly to the masses, allowing them to get used to the idea that one of the most iconic '90s dot-com era logos is changing. And while the campaign was likely a combination of a field test and a marketing gimmick, we'd be surprised if Yahoo ignored 30 days of free public feedback when making a final decision.\xc2\xa0All the logos can be found\xc2\xa0on the Yahoo website[3].\n\nYahoo\n\nThe brand new Yahoo! logo was introduced with a video[4]\xc2\xa0that exhibits Yahoo!'s new youthful identity. The soundtrack is a fairly popular pop song[5], one that many of Yahoo's young Tumblr users will recognize. The new logo displays the same breaching of two worlds, the old Yahoo!and the new, youthful and hip Yahoo.\n\n The logo has many of the same stylistic characteristics found in the old logo - the large 'Y,' the differently shaped 'O's, and the angled exclamation point have all remained. But the font is slimmer, neater, and 3-dimensional, and the purple is deeper and more authoritative. Like eBay before it, Yahoo stuck closely to its original logo, tweaking the style only slightly. Marissa Meyer's Yahoo! is clearly a new Yahoo!, but the core brand is clearly still very much alive.\n\n Old:\n\n http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-12.47.28.png\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/yahoo-new-logo.png\n\n\n\nCrowdsourced:\n\nBy GREYdesigns[6]:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-12.49.11.png\n\n\n\nArbys\n\nThe new Arby's logo and accompanying motto is glossier than the old logo, and boasts a simpler, more modern font to contrast the textured outline of the cowboy hat. The new design direction doesn't follow the omnipresent flat design trend, but it communicates sleekness and modernity while channeling the original 1960s Arby's logo.\n\n Old:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-12.50.25.png\n\n\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.49.13.png\n\n Arby's 1969: \n\n By Ethan Prater[7]/Flickr\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/4592959910_b45fd5cc3d_b.jpg\n\n\n\nWendy's\n\nMeanwhile, Wendy's decided to completely part from its old look, opting for a more friendly and inviting script that radiates freshness, a direction that is reflected in its larger marketing strategy. The logo and advertising campaign set Wendy's apart from competitors by leveraging friendliness and cleanliness as its defining characteristics.\n\n Old:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-12.56.38.png\n\n\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.08.24.png\n\n\n\nMotorola\n\nWhen Motorola Mobility was acquired by Google two yeas ago, it readjusted to a flatter and more colorful design that closely fits in with the Google family. The rebranding was widely accepted as a welcome change.\n\n Old:\xe2\x80\xa8\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/10x1210ibn534moto.jpg\n\n\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.16.36.png\n\n\n\nGap\n\nGap's logo redesign received a notoriously critical backlash, and was scrapped almost immediately. In an interesting turn of events, Gap actually asked the public for their own redesigns following the negative reaction to the new logo, but ended up reversing that decision and keeping the original iconic logo.\n\n Old:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/gap-logo.jpg\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/gap-new.jpg\n\n\n\n Crowdsourced:\n\n By Silence Design[8]:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.22.55.png\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Windows\n\nFun fact: Windows has gone through more logos in the past two decades than any other tech company. The Windows blog actually has a very interesting overview of every logo[9], which accurately reflects larger cultural design trends, from the original blue and grey rarely remembered, to the 8-bit pixelated version that defined 1990s tech style, to the most recent sleek and flat Windows 8 logo.\n\n Windows 3.1:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/2-180212.jpg\n\n Windows Vista:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Vista.jpg\n\n\n\n Windows 8:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/windows-8.jpg\n\n\n\n Crowdsourced:\n\n By Biaggong[10]:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.29.49.png\n\n\n\neBay\n\nebay's logo redesign was subtle, but it is indicative of the larger shift in design trends. The letters are now all lower-case, have lost any overlap, and became uniform in size and shape. The new logo plays nice with all kinds of different media, but successfully retained much of its old character.\n\n Old:\xc2\xa0\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/ebay.png\n\n\n\n New:\n\n\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.32.48.png\n\n\n\n Crowdsourced:\n\n By *[al]barokah[11]:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.33.26.png\n\n\n\n Tropicana\xc2\xa0\n\n Tropicana's new logo suffered a similar fate to Gap's - consumers were upset with the change and reacted negatively, necessitating a complete return to the original logo. Interestingly, Tropicana's new designs were very on point with the modern flat design trend, but consumers didn't trust the new packaging - how do you know it's orange juice if there's no actual orange fruit on the carton?\n\n Old:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.36.46.png\n\n\n\n New (scrapped):\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.38.00.png\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Airlines\n\nAmerican Airlines' logo change is one of the boldest and most talked about from the past few years. The original logo dates back to the 1960s, and was representative of a very different age of design and air travel. The redesigned logo is a complete shift away from the bold font and stylized eagle that graced the airlines' planes for half a century - the eagle remains, but it's only suggested and the shadows and sharp lines are reminiscent of a plane wing.\n\n Old:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.44.09.png\n\n\n\n New:\n\n       \xc2\xa0    http://cdn.thenextweb.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/09/Screen-Shot-2013-09-05-at-13.45.23.png\n\n It's not just old stalwarts of the 20th century that are changing their look - many relatively new tech companies, like MailChimp, have slightly tweaked their logos to better suit responsive technologies. Flatter shapes and colors, simpler lines, and wider spacing are all features of logos that translate well from mobile to web to print, unifying design cross-platform.\n\n When updating your logo in the digital age, the most important takeaway from all of these brands is to prepare your audience and explain your motivations. Not everyone likes change. But everyone likes to be made to feel like his or her opinion counts and to 'be-in-the-know.' It's important for companies to keep consumers in mind at all times.\n\n This\xc2\xa0post\xc2\xa0comes courtesy of\xc2\xa0Fueled[12],\xc2\xa0a mobile design and development company based in New York and London.

The private-label company will offer product lines equal to or better than name brands for a lower price and higher margins for retailers, and will be offered only to McLane customers, according to the company.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Along with rebranding its private-label company to CVP, McLane will debut five new brands and provide an exclusive mix spanning 240-plus foodservice, automotive, candy and snacks, general merchandise, grocery and health, beauty and wellness products. Road-Tech and Work Fare, two of McLane\xe2\x80\x99s established private-label brands, will still be available to consumers through the rebranded CVP line.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n According to a report, 47% of consumers buy more private label today than before the economic downturn began, and one in three U.S. shoppers actively search for store brands to save money. Having founded Salado Sales, its original private-label company in 1993, McLane designed the new comprehensive CVP family of brands to reflect the needs of consumers today, including delivering a product mix that offers relevancy, variety and value, while saving them money.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Under CVP\xe2\x80\x99s umbrella, McLane will make available five new brands consisting of:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n     Hometown Market:  A variety of products like banana nut granola, nuts, trail mix and yogurt pretzels to sugar and creamer that support c-stores foodservice operations, and many of which will also meet The Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA) healthy criteria.\n\n\n\n     Pristyn Purified Water: Also part of the PHA commitment, McLane will support the organization\xe2\x80\x99s signature \xe2\x80\x9cDrink Up\xe2\x80\x9d initiative to help promote more consumption of water. The Pristyn Purified Water is a purified bottled water line to be sold in 100% recycled individual bottles and 24-packs.\n\n\n\n     Excursion Beef Jerky: Protein snack with zesty flavors ranging from Smokey BBQ Pork Jerky, Teriyaki Beef Jerky, Cracked Pepper Beef Jerky to Smokehouse Beef Jerky.\n\n\n\n     YumBees: Various hard, gummy and chocolate candy products as well as a variation of favorite name-brand products.\n\n\n\n     Beau Dacious Biscuits: A new line of quality dog treat products available in peanut butter, grain free yogurt and cranberry bites and assorted treat flavors.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \xe2\x80\x9cConsumers today want the option to purchase quality store-branded products at a reasonable price, so it made sense for us to up our commitment to private label and rebrand to fit the needs of our retail customers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Teresa Voelter, general manager of private label at McLane, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cMcLane\xe2\x80\x99s new comprehensive CVP line provides retailers who don\xe2\x80\x99t already offer a private-label products or have the resources to stock private label inventory the ability to do so and at attractive prices, while keeping their gross margins and profits high.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n McLane plans to roll out additional new products under the CVP family of brands in 2017. Consumers will also be able to utilize a new product search tool located on the new CVP site to find their favorite products at one of the 17,000-plus retailer locations.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n In case of any query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com \n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newswire\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0PRIVATE LABELS (94%); BRANDING (91%); CONSUMERS (90%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (89%); NEW PRODUCTS (78%); PRICES (78%); WATER CONSUMPTION (78%); PRODUCT MANAGEMENT (77%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (67%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (53%); ECONOMIC NEWS (53%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 MCLANE CO INC (93%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0SIC5141 GROCERIES, GENERAL LINE (93%); BRANDING (91%); GROCERIES WHOLESALERS (90%); RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADE (90%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (89%); RETAILERS (89%); BOTTLED WATER (78%); CONSUMER PRODUCTS (78%); CONVENIENCE STORES (78%); NEW PRODUCTS (78%); WATER CONSUMPTION (78%); RESTAURANTS & FOOD SERVICE (77%); SNACK FOODS (77%); CONFECTIONERY (74%); PET FOODS (62%); MATERIALS RECOVERY & RECYCLING (50%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED STATES (92%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 1, 2016\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",McLane Company Rebrands Private-Label Offer,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=8f28709e-eff7-4570-bd9d-59923a04f024&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5KKT-WHB1-DXCW-D2XM-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=400469&pdteaserkey=sr93&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr93&prid=a100e925-071c-49f2-bec7-6685adcc0297,2016-09-01,1.0

While we could focus on individual\xc2\xa0player's forms of expression, we think that organizations, as a whole, do a phenomenal job of presenting their own sense of style. The main way they do\xc2\xa0this is with their logo.<nl/> Logos are meant to encompass everything from the team's mascot to the city in which the organization resides. Save for a few mishaps, team logos are\xc2\xa0tastefully done, artistically sensible, and perfectly thought-out. But as we've seen on multiple occasions, designers can use these logos to show their overall versatility. And by that, of course, we mean redesigning them into shields for a different sport.<nl/> Previously, we showed an excellent example of NFL team logos that were\xc2\xa0transformed in soccer logos[2]. This time around we turn our attention to the exceptional work of Serbian designer\xc2\xa0Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87[3],\xc2\xa0who redesigned\xc2\xa0NBA logos as soccer shields.\xc2\xa0Although all\xc2\xa0of his designs are beautiful, a few stood out among the rest. Here's a look at our five favorite NBA team logos redesigned as soccer crests.<nl/><nl/> 1. Denver Nuggets http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Nuggets-soccer-logo-Milan-Vu%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87-Behance.jpg?a2cf60 Source: Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 (via Behance)<nl/> The Denver Nuggets[4] have a cool uniform and by extension a pretty sweet logo[5]. However, we've always felt that the overall look could use a bit more balance. This newly refined 'Denver Nuggets Football Club' shield is beautifully understated yet pops in all the right places. We dig the yellow Rocky Mountain, the bold star, and sleek light blue\xc2\xa0ring surrounding the whole design. With this redesign, the 'goal' was achieved in more ways than one.<nl/><nl/> 2. Houston Rockets       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Rockets-soccer-logo-Milan-Vu%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87-Behance.jpg?a2cf60 Source: Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 (via Behance)<nl/> With the bright red color, the ringed planet, and a simple 'FC,' we think\xc2\xa0Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 did an outstanding job of creating a Houston Rockets[6] soccer logo devoid of any clutter. Throw in the fact that the shield itself is stunning, and we think that everyone can agree that this particular redesign is 'out of this world.'<nl/><nl/> 3. Los Angeles Clippers       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Clippers-soccer-logo-Milan-Vu%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87-Behance.jpg?a2cf60 Source: Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 (via Behance)<nl/> Let the record show that our appreciation for this Los Angeles Clippers[7] soccer shield was in no way dictated by\xc2\xa0our utter disdain for the team's new look \xe2\x80\x94 easily among the worst uniforms in NBA history[8]. For us, this logo cruises on the basis of its beautiful crown, flawless line work, and regal-esque 'C' in the middle. If only this redesign could help the Clippers get out of the ultra-competitive Western Conference. Then it would be perfect.<nl/><nl/> 4. Minnesota Timberwolves       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Timberwolves-soccer-logo-Milan-Vu%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87-Behance.jpg?a2cf60 Source: Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 (via Behance)<nl/> For the first time in a while, Minnesota Timberwolves[9] fans can find a reason to feel optimistic. And we're not just talking about the superstar potential of this year's No. 1 overall pick Karl-Anthony Towns. We're referring to this smooth, simple, and perfectly proportioned soccer logo. While it may be part of the organizations's namesake, we've never actually loved how the\xc2\xa0wolf is incorporated into the team's logo. With these staggered\xc2\xa0evergreen trees, the new shield exudes style and class. This is a slam dunk if we've ever seen one.<nl/><nl/> 5. Portland Trail Blazers       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Trail-Blazers-soccer-logo-Milan-Vu%C4%8Dkovi%C4%87-Behance.jpg?a2cf60 Source: Milan Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 (via Behance)<nl/> The Portland Trail Blazers[10]' 'pinwheel' logo is one of the most beautiful symbols in all of professional sports. In this soccer logo redesign,\xc2\xa0Vu\xc4\x8dkovi\xc4\x87 does a superb job of accenting an already impeccable\xc2\xa0design, while utilizing a smooth double-outlined pentagon and a bold, red eight-pointed star.

Apart from GCC countries, TEC has also executed successful events in Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, Egypt, Moldova, Bulgaria, Turkey, Romania, Serbia, Croatia, Czech Republic, Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nEmbracing its new logo and brand identity, TEC is focused on corporate events which include conferences, exhibitions, product launches, gala dinners, meetings and incentives.\n\nAccording to managing director Crampton: ""We initially started out as purely a corporate events agency but over time our clients have requested us to manage their digital campaigns, PR and more recently social media. Whilst the name \xe2\x80\x98The Event Company\xe2\x80\x99 initially worked very well for us, in the last couple of years it has been somewhat limiting.

Rebranding can occur as a result of expansion into new markets, new management, internalization, outdated image, and more.

TanTate Innovative Solutions is introducing new services that focus on mother-daughter relationships. Their aim is to reposition their brand to target new, more specific audiences with important needs.

5,The Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive_,The Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive_.docx,95,Word/The Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive_.docx,The Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive_,"b""Page  of \n\nThe Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive?\n\nBusiness 2 Community.com\n\nJune 2, 2013 Sunday 7:50 PM EST\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa01182 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 02, 2013 (Business 2 Community.com:http://www.business2community.com Delivered by Newstex)\n\n In 2012 logo redesign was very popular with some of the biggest brands. From Arby's to Wendy's - with eBay, Corvette and Dominoes in between - some of America's biggest hitters were bent on having a facelift. In fact, the only thing that outnumbered logo upgrades was the slew of responses to those upgrades. It seems when it comes to redesigning images seen as global institutions everyone has an opinion.\n\n For businesses thinking of a logo redesign, the experiences of recent years tell you two things. First - if logo change is good enough for Microsoft, it's good enough for you. And second - if a corporate giant like Gap can get it wrong, then any company undergoing an upgrade is taking a risk. In other words, when it comes to logo redesign - can your brand survive?\n\nAsses if Change is Necessary\n\nBut before you ask if your brand can survive, you need to ask if change is necessary. Your answer might be 'yes' is if your logo appears dated. Some designs are timeless (think Coca-Cola - arguably the world's most recognized brand[1]). On the other hand, if yours has the appearance of something that should have been left in a bygone millennium, then an update is vital. But a redesign isn't just about how your logo looks, it's about what it represents.\n\nLet Your Brand Guide Your Logo\n\nIf your brand is your company's personality, then the logo is its face. But if your business has changed over time then your logo might not fit your brand. So when potential customers use your logo to identify who you are, they could be getting it wrong.\n\n It's what you do as a company that makes your logo work - a logo gets its meaning from its brand. And brands are created by the way we perceive them. A new logo won't make us see a brand in a completely new or different way, but it can certainly help influence how we respond to a company.\n\nYou Don't Have to be Literal\n\nA common mistake is to feel the need to use an image that details what your business does - like a steaming cup for a coffee company. Just think how many other coffee sellers will settle on the same idea. Logos don't need to be literal - often the best ones are symbolic instead of functional. The newest Starbucks coffee icon has no name and no cup - it represents the personality of the company, not the product.\n\n\n\nNotice how even an established market leader like Starbucks had to advertise their new 2011 logo to their customer base\n\nConsider Color\n\nColor is key, but it's complex. You can look at leading brands to get an idea that blue is corporate, red is fashion or food and green is any company wanting to project an ecologically progressive or health-conscious image. What you also need to think about is the global potential of your brand - a color can mean one thing in the US and something completely different abroad.\n\n Keeping to the Starbucks example, we can see how a logo's color helps make the right impact. Most companies selling coffee opt for brown. Starbucks not only stands out from the crowd with the choice of a green logo, it also sends messages of a brand that is fresh as well as environmentally aware.\n\n Whatever color you settle on, always make sure your logo looks great in black and white - it'll be seen this way more than you'd think.\n\nStrive for Simplicity\n\nThere's nothing simple about redesigning a logo. But that doesn't mean a logo shouldn't be simple. One way to achieve this is to have an uncluttered design. If we return to Starbucks again you'll see that over the years the logo has become simpler and more pared down. This is the way most companies are heading. Amidst the noise of the consumer market it's a welcome respite to come across something simple.\n\nUse Vectors\n\nAnd a sure way to achieve simplicity is to design in vectors. Vectors are great options over bitmap (jpeg) images because they don't use pixels. This provides the ability to create a clear, clean logo, whether it's reproduced on a stamp or a billboard. If you're a graphic artist, you'll know exactly what vectors are and what they do. But if, like most of us, you're not a trained designer then you can find an easy guide to vector icons[2] here.\n\nUse Responsive Images\n\nVectors help a logo to work across multiple media types. The ability to upsize and downsize means the logo will fit anywhere. But when it comes to dimensions and orientation, use responsive images. This means that you can design a logo that adapts to suit any screen size - from a portrait cell to a landscape laptop. If your company design department is you, read through a guide to creating responsive images[3].\n\nKeep Cost in Mind\n\nAs a business everything comes down to cost. And the price of changing a logo is not just the cost of the image. Even if you get your icon for a steal, you have to consider the cost of rolling that icon out across your company.\n\n From business cards to packaging, your logo will be on everything. Which means a redesign is a huge financial investment. And changes to the logo will mean changes to your company identity - your icon must fit seamlessly into everything visual associated with your business, from store fronts to uniforms.\n\n So at this stage your logo may have been approved by the partners and signed off by the CEO, but any successful business understands who really holds the power - your customers. Can your brand survive an expensive misjudgement[4]? This is where the three Rs come into play:\n\nResearch. Research. Research.\n\nAny company is asking for trouble if you redesign a logo without first soft launching to at least one focus group - even if you're a business of one and your test audience is your mom. That said, if your mom isn't the demographic you're pitching your product to, then it's time to work out who is. Because researching your customer base is as important as getting their opinions once you've found them.\n\n Gap's logo fail of 2010[5] meant that after a single week of online backlash, the clothes company retreated to their original icon. The lesson here is always do your homework. And recognize you don't need to completely redesign your logo. Like Starbucks, you can just give it a gentle retouch. This way - with the right marketing of you company's new face - you can keep the trust of your loyal customer base and still reach out to new demographics.\n\n As you make your choices about your logo redesign keep this in mind: the best logos are simple, memorable and timeless.\n\n Stock Images[6] provided by BigStock Photo\n\n [1]: http://www.interbrand.com/en/best-global-brands/2012/Best-Global-Brands-2012-Brand-View.aspx [2]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.bigstockphoto.com/blog/an-intro-to-working-with-vectors/ [3]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.shutterstock.com/blog/2013/05/how-to-use-responsive-images-to-make-your-site-shine-on-any-platform/ [4]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1914815_1914808_1914804,00.html/ [5]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2010/10/new-gap-logo-despised-symbol-of-corporate-banality-dead-at-one-week [6]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.bigstockphoto.com/ \n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Blog\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa0BIZC-115198\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); REBRANDING (90%); SALES PROSPECTING (78%); BRAND EQUITY (73%); Brand logo (%); logo change (%); Branding (%); logo design (%); design (%); marketing (%); logo (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 MICROSOFT CORP (56%);  COCA-COLA CO (55%)\n\n\n\nOrganization:\xc2\xa0Corvette; Microsoft; Starbucks; The Coca-Cola Company; eBay\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0MSFT (NASDAQ) (56%); KO (NYSE) (55%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS511210 SOFTWARE PUBLISHERS (56%); SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE (56%); NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING (55%); SIC2086 BOTTLED & CANNED SOFT DRINKS & CARBONATED WATER (55%); SOFT DRINKS (91%); BOTTLED WATER (90%); BRANDING (90%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (90%); MANUFACTURING (90%); REBRANDING (90%); SOFT DRINK INDUSTRY (90%); SOFTWARE MAKERS (90%); COFFEE (89%); COFFEE & TEA STORES (89%); COFFEE & TEA (79%); BEVERAGE MFG (78%); BRAND EQUITY (73%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED STATES (90%)\n\n\nUnited States\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0June 6, 2013\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",The Logo Redesign - Can Your Brand Survive_.docx,,,0.0

No More. I\'m fine with the store brand from here on out.""\xc2\xa0\n\nUsers online then began to bring out political and social issues with the design change.Mindy Robinson, currently running for Congress, commented, ""I see the left found a way to be offended at Land O Lakes butter. I guess we\'ll just erase that part of history where Native Americans were the first to bring farming and agriculture to this country.""\xc2\xa0\n\nTwitter user @Caissie stated, ""Next time I buy butter, I will buy Land O Lakes to show that I appreciate their company trying to do better. The opposite of a boycott. What do we call that? (Girlcott is too on the nose. Calling for ALTs.)""\n\nDoes the brand changing its logo really need to be politicized? It\'s a marketing move yet commentators and Twitter users are finding a way to adjust it to their agendas and weaponize it. Not everything is a large scale social issue nor a part of identity politics.\xc2\xa0\n\nHowever, Twitter user @CeeEyes made a very interesting point, ""Thousands of native women have gone missing but the only one some white Americans care about is the one on the Land-O-Lakes package.""\n\nNow, specifically targeting white Americans is a bit unnecessary, but the point being made is important. There is an epidemic of Native American women that go missing and the issue is often swept under the rug. CNN reported that ""one estimate from the National Crime Information Center shows 5,712 reports of missing Native American women in 2016 alone.""\n\nSo, as CeeEyes pointed out, thousands of Native American women have been going missing, but for some reason people are only fixated on the one that is now missing from butter packaging.\xc2\xa0\n\nThe boycotting and fixation of the logo change is a bit harebrained. We have a global pandemic going on, so butter should be the last of our concerns and last I checked, packing hardly ever tampers with the taste and quality of a product. Packaging really is simply a cosmetic lure, it\'s a bit childish to completely boycott a brand just because of a logo change, it\'s similar to a child rejecting a peanut butter and jelly sandwich just because it was cut into halves and not triangles.\xc2\xa0\n\nOn the social side, I haven\'t seen many Native Americans commenting on the issue. I, as a Native American myself, personally haven\'t taken any issue with the logo change. I don\'t entirely see why other Native Americans would either because the original artwork was designed by Patrick DesJarlait, a Native American Ojibwe artist.\xc2\xa0\n\nNative Americans don\'t need others fighting for us when we aren\'t entirely bothered ourselves. Instead, direct your attention to issues that do target and bother us such as the Washington Redskins and the thousands of missing Native American women.

The alt-weekly\xe2\x80\x99s management says it will only make this change if Philadelphians donate at least $5,900 to their Kickstarter, a number Chairman and Publisher Dan McDonough said would indicate the work would have an audience.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBeing \xe2\x80\x98alt\xe2\x80\x99 in 2020 is different than it was years ago,\xe2\x80\x9d the campaign reads. \xe2\x80\x9cConservatives are the ones who no longer have a voice -- especially here in Philly.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf this shift happens, current editor-in-chief Kerith Gabriel wrote in a column Wednesday that he will step down from his role. McDonough said he asked Gabriel, a former Daily News sports reporter, to stay on as the \xe2\x80\x9cchief antagonist.\xe2\x80\x9d In his column, Gabriel called this offer \xe2\x80\x9cintriguing"" and said \xe2\x80\x9cpointing out what is amiss in these diatribes isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad thing""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI want us to be the kind of place where all voices are heard,"" McDonough said. ""And my relationship with Kerith is strong enough that he can gut punch us and we can still remain close.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIf Philly Weekly makes this change, McDonough said it will continue to focus on local, Philadelphia issues. They will still publish their calendar section, arts and entertainment pieces and publish wide-ranging points of view in the Voices in Our City section. The main change, McDonough said, is \xe2\x80\x9ca shift in the focus of our cover stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe fund-raising campaign\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, McDonough said, is to discover if Philadelphians have an appetite for a conservative alt weekly. ""We\xe2\x80\x99re not only looking at the dollar amount, but the number of those contributing. That will tell us a lot about how sustainable this move could be.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPrint media across the country is struggling as advertising revenues plummet, especially during the coronavirus epidemic. McDonough said testing this change is both an editorial and financial decision.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinancially, we have to stand out from the pack to both readers and advertisers to thrive,"" McDonough wrote. ""Lately, our journalism looks pretty much like everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s journalism. That isn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x98alternative\xe2\x80\x99 at all, and we don\xe2\x80\x99t stand out.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPhiladelphia Weekly began as the Welcomat in 1971, before rebranding in 1995. The current Kickstarter described the publication as one \xe2\x80\x9cfor the people who called Philly home and didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a voice -- against city hall, against whomever \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d When McDonough Jr. bought Philly Weekly in 2018, it was the outlet\xe2\x80\x99s second sale in three years. McDonough Jr.\'s twitter bio simply says \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Capitalist.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlt-weeklies may be seen as traditionally having a liberal ideology, but John Heaston, the Association of Alternative Newsmedia board president, said \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s never been a thing for us that you\xe2\x80\x99re progressive or conservative.""\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAlternatives,"" he said, ""have been defined by doing the stories that weren\xe2\x80\x99t told, speaking truth to power and going deeper.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThough it isn\xe2\x80\x99t unusual for outlets to seek fund-raising from readers, Heaston said he has never seen anything like this.\n\nThe Kickstarter campaign included certain packages depending on the donation amount, allowing donors to spend up to between $400 and at least $1,250 for top-tier rewards, like the ability to be a columnist, the chance to \xe2\x80\x9ctakeover\xe2\x80\x9d Philly Weekly\xe2\x80\x99s Instagram and credit in Philly Weekly\xe2\x80\x99s masthead and the \xe2\x80\x9cAbout Us\xe2\x80\x9d page. (It is not common practice for news media to offer people a chance to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy\xe2\x80\x9d a column, a place on the masthead, or a chance to run social media pages.)\n\nThis announcement came as a surprise to recent freelancers and upset former staffers who described the change as disappointing.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you do journalism you\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to write the truth. You\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to be like \xe2\x80\x98If we raise 5,900 bucks we\xe2\x80\x99ll be conservative,\'"" said former Philly Weekly writer Dan McQuade, who is now a staff writer at Defector. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me worry. If you can be bought that easily then why should I trust anything that the publication has to say?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWhen Managing Editor Alan Bauer didn\xe2\x80\x99t approve Jason N. Peters\' recent pitch, the freelancer said he first thought he had done something wrong. But last Friday, Bauer told him they were \xe2\x80\x9con hold for approving future stories.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nNow Peters, 25, thinks Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s announcement is why. He said this alt-weekly gave him his \xe2\x80\x9cfirst shot\xe2\x80\x9d at journalism and he feels \xe2\x80\x9cblinded\xe2\x80\x9d by this potential move. He said he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write for them again.\n\nAn upsetting thing about Philly Weekly choosing to become \xe2\x80\x9cConservative\xe2\x80\x9d is that they think my news pieces about like prison conditions, marijuana, gun violence, & homelessness were \xe2\x80\x9cprogressive.\xe2\x80\x9dI thought I was just doing the news, there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing political about human rights.\n\n-- jason n. peters (@JPeters2100) September 22, 2020\n\nOthers took to Twitter to criticize the alt-weekly\xe2\x80\x99s announcement. The extensive social media backlash led the outlet to respond after 9 p.m. Tuesday to further explain its \xe2\x80\x9cshift in philosophy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going to wave the flag for @realDonaldTrump, drop our support for LGBTQ, BIPOC, the marginalized or disenfranchised or rename the paper \xe2\x80\x9cQAnon Weekly,\xe2\x80\x9d the account said in a Twitter thread. \xe2\x80\x9cSecond, here\xe2\x80\x99s what we will do: Publish stories about Philadelphia issues written by Philadelphia writers, but take a different approach than local mainstream media by focusing on the matters and voices who often are underreported or not reported at all.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThank you Philly for the ratio, replies and QTs. RIP the original PW.\n\n-- Helen Gym (@HelenGymPHL) September 22, 2020\n\nThis possible switch by Philly Weekly would not be seen as competition to Albert Eisenberg, a founder of Broad + Liberty, a news media outlet launched a year ago that publishes conservative viewpoints, and one he describes as \xe2\x80\x9csharing stories and voices that are shut out otherwise from other outlets.""\n\nHe welcomes more media outlets in the city that aim to fill what he sees as a gap in coverage.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to improve civic dialogue and better cover the stories that exist, and this media ecosystem is very fast-moving and very unstable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eisenberg, a Philadelphia-based political consultant and former communications director for the Philadelphia Republican Party, who has contributed to the Inquirer. ""So we welcome more people taking a crack at it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sad and more than a little desperate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tim Whitaker, a longtime former editor of Philly Weekly, and founder of nonprofit Mighty Writers. \xe2\x80\x9cAlt newspapers have been disappearing for years, but I think it should have had a dignified death, not a reinvention into something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any sense, in a city where there is no audience for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n___ (c)2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer Visit The Philadelphia Inquirer at www.inquirer.com Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 24, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Philadelphia Weekly might rebrand to become more conservative ,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=fba1ed6c-0fbe-4b22-8c71-6a5fc6cc0909&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60X6-RT61-JC6P-C0YB-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=169235&pdteaserkey=sr20&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr20&prid=67c1ed24-374b-4859-8b80-0ea1604ac5d9,2020-09-23,0.0

Frequently companies redesign their logos, and many redesigns result in more rounded logos. How do such redesigns affect consumers\' brand attitudes? The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of brand commitment on consumer response to logo shape redesign. In This research uses a field experiment with 632 respondents and examines two athletic shoe brands: New Balance and Adidas. The greater the degree of change in the roundedness of a previously angular logo, the more likely it is that strongly committed consumers will evaluate the redesigned logo more negatively (in terms of brand attitude). Such logo evaluations, in turn, mediate the joint effect of logo redesign and commitment on overall brand attitude. Conversely, weakly committed consumers react positively to such changes.\n\nKeywords: Brand identity, Brand loyalty, Logos, Brand value\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAccording to the American Marketing Association (AMA), a brand is a ""name, term, sign, symbol, or a combination of them, intended to identify the goods and services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competition"" (Keller, 2003, p. 3). Thus, the key to creating a brand, according to the AMA definition, is to be able to choose a name, logo, symbol, package design, or other attribute that identifies a product and distinguishes it from others (Aaker, 1991, 1996; Kapferer, 1997). The various components of brands, that identify and differentiate them, are termed brand elements. According to Keller (2003) the most powerful brand elements are brand names, logos, slogans, jingles, characters, and packages.\n\nThe brand is a powerful visual language used to support a company\'s communication with its consumers. The goal of the brand is to create a lasting impression that results in a consumer bond and creates loyal customers. The logo is the point of entry to a brand. Image is a reflection of the brand strategy. Being a visual tool that supports the brand, logos are very important. A logo is the face of a brand, but it is not the brand. However it helps it to be identified. Not having a logo would be like being a faceless person. One might have a great physique, a great personality and a radio voice, but without a face no one would ever be able to identify that person. There would be nothing to tie all those things together. However the logo is the mental image of a brand, it is the fastest way for a firm to be recognized and even preferred, a logo by itself is not a brand, but a brand without a logo is, in my opinion, incomplete.\n\nBrands send messages to consumers that the products or services they represent are superior to those of their marketplace rivals (Dickinson and Svensen, 2000). This is becoming increasingly important as today\'s consumer becomes more and more ""cash rich and time poor,"" meaning that consumers are forced to rely on corporate identity and product branding to help them choose quickly among an ever-increasing number of competing products and services (Dickinson and Svensen, 2000). Symbols like brand logos are more than ""mere labels"" for branded products; they serve as ""visual shorthand"" for communicating a brand message and promise to consumers (Selame, 1988). These symbols can be large, like a set of McDonald\'s arches that can be seen for miles along the highway, or small, like an understated tabletop sign in a window on Manhattan\'s Fifth Avenue, depending on the target audience. But no matter what kind of sign it is that people expect to see, they do navigate through life relying on corporate logos for guidance. ""Motorists look for KFC\'s big red and white striped bucket on roadsides, and can notice the scalloped seashell of a Shell gas station or the double Xs of an Exxon very quickly. Modern consumers do not look for names, but for these corporate symbols instead"" (Selame, 1988).\n\nThe work of Andy Warhol and Heidi Cody remind us of the power of brands as cultural symbols. For many company\'s, the brand is a company\'s trademark. Numerous authors have presented definitions for a brand. Kotler (Kotler, 2000) defined it as ""a name, term, sign, symbol, or design, or a combination of them, intended to identify the goods or services of one seller or group of sellers and to differentiate them from those of competitors"". Murphy (Murphy, 1990) identified a brand as a product or service of a particular supplier that is differentiated by its name and presentation. According to Kapferer (Kapferer, 1997), a brand has two different functions: to distinguish products from each other and to indicate a product\'s origin. Although there are many definitions for a brand, they do not contain the whole meaning of what a brand is. Morgan (Morgan, 1999) defined it as, ""A brand is one of the most important design equities owned by a company."" Branding is ideally done in a manner that appeals to the needs and wants of the proposed target audience, and thus communicates to that audience issues that give them a positive impression (Yastrow, 2003). A strong brand can create a high degree of loyalty and thus build a solid sales base (Kapferer, 1997). A brand needs to accurately represent the company and reach the emotions of the consumer to attain the status of ""lovemark,"" thereby gaining loyalty. This can rejuvenate a brand\'s identity, much like a ""love potion"" that blends three ingredients: mystery, sensuality and intimacy (Roberts, 2005).\n\n""On a more multifaceted level, a brand is the sum total of all functional and emotional assets that differentiate it among the competition and distinguish it in the audience\'s mind.""(Landa, 2006).\n\nIn 2003, Apple Computer announced it was recoloring its logo from red to brushed silver. Within hours of Apple\'s announcement, more than 200 people had signed an online petition demanding Apple\'s return to the old logo (Kahney, 2003).In contrast, the recent redesigns of Walmart\'s logo elicited less customer response (Benton County Daily Record, 2008 ; Edwards, 2008).Why might that be? One explanation may be that although Apple has relatively fewer customers, most of their customers have very strong brand commitment, whereas Walmart customers, although there are many, have lower levels of brand commitment. More intriguingly, how and why does a slight change to a brand\'s visual elements (e.g. logo color or shape) affect consumers so differently, depending on their levels of brand commitment? What are the implications for brand attitude and consequent branding strategies? We explore these questions theoretically and empirically. Drawing on the literature in aesthetics and consumer information processing, we hypothesize the impact of logo- redesign on logo evaluation and brand attitude. More importantly, we develop a theory about the moderating role of consumer brand commitment. We then conduct a large- scale experiment to test our theoretical predictions.\n\n2. Brand Aesthetics and Logo Redesign\n\nThe history of logos goes back to prehistoric ages. The first logos have been drawn on the walls of caves. ""They were the symbols of personal and group beliefs and evolved from desire and need for social communication and identification of certain \'truths\'.""(Thomas, 2000). The word \'logo\' first used in ancient Greek. They were the symbols consisting of one or more letters. These typically represented the initial letters of a person or place for use on stationary and signs. Many early Greek and Roman coins bear the monograms or logos of rulers or towns.\n\nLogos are one of the base elements in a corporate identity or brand identity. They are the visual representation of what a company is. They trigger people\'s memories of previous experiences with the company and other implementations of the logo, leaving a greater impact than words can alone do. They are the graphic links to the message that a brand promises and communicates and the relationship a company can develop between its brand and its customers. So they become one of the strongest tools for building and reinforcing a brand image and maintaining its value. Also a logo plays a key role in building loyalty and trust in a brand because it provokes an immediate reaction.\n\nThe logo is arguably the most important part of the brand, as it is the part of a company\'s brand message that is most visible to consumers and, ideally, it comes to stand for the brand itself in their minds. Paul Dickinson (Dickinson and Svenson, 2000) describes a debate in the graphic design world about whether or not the design of such a logo really matters. His co-author and colleague, Neil Svensen, argues that it does not matter ""if your logo is a nasty drawing of a dead goat\'s head"" (Dickinson and Svenson, 2000) as long as it is used consistently. Others, like the late design genius Paul Rand who, in an interview with Stephen Heller (Heller, 1989), noted that designers should not do things ""willy-nilly,"" believe strongly that careful logo design is of the utmost importance in effectively communicating a brand\'s message to consumers.\n\nThe logo is the central element of a corporate identity design and virtually all corporate identities include a logo (Rowden, 2000). As former president of the General Cinema Corporation once noted, ""the first impression of a company is often its name and logo"" . The logo itself does not define a corporate image, but acts as a symbol of that image. Even if they don\'t become iconic or assimilate themselves into pop culture, logos can serve as reminders of larger corporate images that would otherwise be too overwhelming for consumers to recall (Selame, 1988).\n\nAs a brand element, a logo can be defined as a graphic representation or image that triggers memory associations of the target brand. Tom Peters (1999) recognized the importance of a visually strong logo: Humans think visually. A picture is really worth a million words. And great brands have readily identifiable icons--just ask Nike or Apple or Shell--strong simple images that connect with customers.\n\nLogos are a prominent feature of a diverse array of direct and indirect communication vehicles ranging from packaging, promotional materials, and advertising to uniforms, business cards, and letterheads (Bottomly and Doyle, 2006; Henderson and Cote, 1998 ; Janiszewski and Meyvis, 2001). To this end, firms have also started to pay substantial attention to brand aesthetics, which encompasses an evaluation of the visual elements of a brand such as product, package, and logo designs (Burrows, 2008; Business Week, 2007; Scanlon, 2006). Firms such as Perception Research Services reported conducting hundreds of design and aesthetics studies every year for various clients including Kraft, Nestle, Wrigley, Target, and General Mills (Mininni, 2005). Interestingly, among the various brand elements examined, brand logo (apart from product and package design) is the most salient visual brand element for customers (Mininni, 2005). Not surprisingly, one in 50 companies will redesign their logo in a given year (Spaeth, 2002), and at considerable expense. For instance, UPS spent $20 million to introduce a new logo in 2003 (Griswold, 2003), while Xerox invested multimillions to update its logo (Xerox, 2008). Given the expense involved, firms would benefit by knowing which customers are likely to respond more or less favorably to such changes in their logo. Answers to these questions, though important, have not received systematic scrutiny. This is true despite some research conducted to systematically categorize various logo design elements (see Henderson and Cote, 1998 ; Henderson et al., 2003, for exceptions). Henderson and Cote (1998) provided a systematic typology to classify and study the visual elements of a logo, including the concepts of naturalness, harmony, elaborateness, parallelism, repetition, proportion, and shape. Madden et al. (2000) found that colors such as blue and white, when included in a logo, share similar meaning across countries, while colors such as black and red have considerably different meanings and associations. Klink (2003) found that brand names with front vowels and fricatives (the letters s, f, v, and c) were more closely related to lighter-colored brand names and angular brand logos. Later, Henderson et al. (2003) examined how customers from different cultures perceive different logo elements. A cross-sectional survey showed that consumers in China and Singapore perceived natural and harmonious logo designs more positively, whereas consumers in Western cultures perceived abstract and asymmetric logo designs more positively. The role of elaborateness as a primary driver of consumer perceptions of logos, followed by naturalness and harmony, was verified in another study as well (Henderson et al., 2004). Furthermore, it was found that the roundedness of a logo was a canonical feature of perceptions of logo harmony and naturalness. In particular, the more rounded the elements of a logo (as opposed to angular or sharp), the more it was viewed as being harmonious and natural. Thus, both from a theoretical and empirical perspective, the roundedness of a logo is a key design element.\n\nInterestingly, practitioners also view the roundedness of logo elements (as opposed to angular and sharp elements) as an emergent trend that is likely to endure. We interviewed 12 leading logo designers from multiple firms. The firms included the four largest corporate-identity firms as identified by the American Institute of Graphic Artists (AIGA):\n\n* Interbrand;\n\n* Landor and Associates;\n\n* Lippencott and Margulies; and\n\n* Siegel and Gale.\n\nWe also included six design firms from the mid-Atlantic area and a northeastern art institute. All interviewees (100 percent) indicated a trend toward increased use of rounded shapes for logos. One designer commented, ""[The tendency is toward] the use of more round-like shape. I see logos having a more bulbous design."" Another designer stated, ""There is a movement toward traditional design. I think this is a response to the \'go-go\' craziness of the dot--com era."" The designers also discussed brand globalization and explained that more brands are moving into Asian countries where roundedness is preferred to angularity in shapes (Zhang et al., 2006).\n\nFinally, to verify that roundedness was indeed a logo-design element worth investigating, we analyzed Logos Redesigned (Carter, 2005), a collection of 192 recent logo redesigns. Two coders classified each redesigned logo as:\n\n* no shape change;\n\n* more angular shape from being initially rounded; or\n\n* more rounded shape from being initially angular\n\n(87 percent initial agreement, differences resolved through discussion).\n\nResults indicated that 50 percent of all logos had changed shape. Among logos that had changed shape, 68 percent were more rounded; only the remaining 32 percent became more angular ( p< 0.05).\n\nThus, from a design perspective, we decided to examine this particular logo element rounded shape--as our measure of the extent of logo redesign. In other words, in our empirical study we varied the extent of roundness of the logo to study its impact on logo evaluations and brand attitude among consumers.\n\n3. What Makes a Good Logo?\n\nLogos should be (i) recognizable, (ii) elicit a consensually held meaning in the target market, and (iii) evoke positive affect (Cohen, 1986 ; Vartorella, 1990). Each of these goals is discussed next. The discussion is based on earlier work on brand logos (Cohen, 1986 ; Robertson, 1989 ; Vartorella, 1990).(1) Recognizable: Logos should speed recognition of a destination (Peter, 1989). The rationale is that images are perceived faster than words. This is important because most destination advertising is only seen briefly (e.g. ads on billboards, in magazines or on the Internet). Logo recognition occurs at two levels. First, consumers must remember having seen the logo earlier (recognition). Second, logos must be connected with the correct destination (recall). The former depends largely on design. Therefore, facilitating recall of the destination logo starts with the selection of a design that can be easily recognized and that creates a sense of familiarity. Familiarity can benefit a logo because it can increase affect. It can also create more consensually held meanings, and even enhance choice of a destination if destination experience is limited. Furthermore, logos that look familiar tend to be perceived and processed faster. (2) Meaningful: The logo literature emphasizes that a logo should readily evoke the same intended meaning across people (e.g. Durgee and Stuart, 1987). Keller (1993,2003) similarly argues that marketing stimuli should communicate one clear message that is difficult to misinterpret. If the logo has a clear meaning, it can be linked more easily to the destination. Therefore, it is important to choose a logo design that communicates the most appropriate destination message. (3) Affective: Positive affective reactions are critical to logo success because affect can transfer from the logo to the destination. Recent research suggests that evaluations of a logo can affect evaluations of a destination (see Keller, 2003). The extent to which affect is transferred depends on the nature of the evoked feelings (positive or negative), how intense the affective reactions are, and how closely the logo is associated with the destination. Positive affect can be evoked by the initial design of the logo or it can be developed over time with increased logo exposure (Zajonc, 1968). Often affective transfer can be hard to suppress. However, to manage transfer of affect from a logo to a destination some aspects of similarity between the logo and the destination are required (Henderson & Cote, 1998). However, little is known about how to develop logos representing tourist destinations (Cai, 2002). Based on the literature review it seems important to focus on four dimensions: (i) the vision of how a destination should be perceived should drive ideas about the core essence of the destination, which should be used as the brief for designers, (ii) logo familiarity, (iii) logo design that signals destination meaning, and (iv) aspects of similarity between the logo and the destination. In the next section, the three partners involved in developing the destination logo are presented.\n\n4. Changes in Logo Shape\n\nBerlyne\'s (1960) seminal work identified the psychological processes relating the aesthetic dimensions of stimuli to the perceiver\'s responses. Empirical research in aesthetics (Arnheim, 1974; Aronoff et al., 1992; Berlyne, 1976) has shown that shape plays an important role in perceptions. Applying those ideas to marketing, research has examined how visual elements of the marketing mix such as advertising (Bloch, 1995) and new-product design (Page and Herr, 2002; Veryzer and Hutchinson, 1998) affect customer reactions. More recently, Zhang et al. (2006) examined the effect of product shape on product evaluations among collectivist and individualistic cultures. Despite the descriptive research on logos and attempts to classify logo-design elements, little if any research has systematically examined how changes in logos affect consumer attitudes.\n\nResearch has shown that viewers clearly differentiate between two versions--rounded and angular--of the same stimulus. They interpret the rounded version of a stimulus to be a compromise between the focal stimulus and its surroundings (Arnheim, 1974 ; Hogg, 1969).Typically, roundedness is associated with approachableness, friendliness, and harmony (Berlyne, 1960 ; 1976). In contrast, angularity is associated with energy, toughness, and strength. Based on the visual aesthetics literature, we argue that consumers will clearly differentiate and perceive a change based on differences in the angularity and roundedness of a logo.\n\nNote, we do not argue that one shape is better than the other. We simply argue that if an original logo was more angular and became more rounded, consumers would see that the logo was different. Our main goal, therefore, is to examine how the magnitude of change in logo affects subsequent consumer evaluations. Next, we theoretically examine whether the magnitude of change in logo will similarly affect consumers based on their level of brand commitment.\n\n5. Brand Commitment: a Moderator Of Consumer Response to Logo Redesign\n\nBrand commitment can be viewed as ""an enduring desire to maintain a valued relationship"" with the brand (Moorman and Zaltman, 1992, 316). Brand commitment develops over time (Keller, 2005). Consumers having strong levels of commitment, who have nurtured strong relationships with their brand, tend to see strong connections between themselves and the brand (Escalas and Bettman, 2003) and consider the brands to be an integral part of their lives (Fournier, 1998). Visually, brand logos convey a very different meaning to consumers with strong brand commitment than to consumers with moderate or no brand commitment. This is particularly true because, as a visual cue, brand logos can become the basis for triggering brand-related associations and thoughts in consumer memory (Keller, 2005). To the extent that the brand associations and their strength emerging from the brand logo vary based on commitment, we expect a change in logo to differentially affect consumers based on their commitment to the brand.\n\nWe argue that strongly committed consumers are likely to view logo changes as threatening their relationship with the brand (Ahluwalia et al., 2000). Those with strong brand commitment will see the original brand logo--and the associations--as representing themselves (Escalas and Bettman, 2003) and the integral relationship they have with the brand (Fournier, 1998). They are likely to view a change in the logo, which affects these associations, as threatening their self-brand connections (Escalas and Bettman, 2003) and relationships (Fournier, 1998). Consequently, such consumers will be negatively disposed to the logo change and likely to evaluate the logo negatively. This logic is consistent with an information-processing perspective (Ahluwalia et al., 2000). Accordingly, information that is inconsistent (i.e. the redesigned logo with rounded shape) with the original brand- self concept motivates consumers to defend the relationship by evaluating the new information (i.e. redesigned logos) negatively. We argue that the effect should be greater for the strongly committed based on the degree of change.\n\nConversely, for consumers with weak brand commitment, a changed logo would not be as meaningful. Such customers are unlikely to see the brand as an integral part of their being and should have little or no personal relationship with the brand. They are likely to perceive a change in the logo\'s shape as novel, which will lead them to evaluate the logo more positively (Kohlia and Suri, 2002). Thus the redesign will generate positive attitudes about the brand. In particular, the greater the change in brand logo shape, the more positive the attitude toward the brand for consumers with weak brand commitment. Therefore:\n\nH1. Brand commitment will moderate the influence of change in the roundedness of a logo shape on brand attitude. Specifically, for consumers with strong brand commitment, brand attitude will decline as the degree of change in logo shape increases. Conversely, for consumers with weak brand commitment, brand attitude will increase as the degree of change in logo shape increases.\n\nRegarding the relationship between logo evaluation and brand attitude, we argue that strongly committed consumers will evaluate logo shape changes more negatively, and their reaction will be reflected in lower brand attitudes. This is likely because logos, as a central visual element of the overall brand, will trigger corresponding brand associations. Thus, if consumers evaluate the logo negatively, their evaluation should also trigger similarly valenced (i.e. negative) brand associations and lead to more negative brand attitudes. To the extent that strongly committed consumers are likely to view the redesigned logo negatively, more negative brand associations will be triggered, leading to more negative brand attitude. In contrast, more positive brand associations among those with weak brand commitment should lead to more positive brand attitude in response to a logo redesign. Based on this, we posit that logo evaluation will mediate the joint effect of brand commitment and degree of logo shape change on brand attitude. Thus:\n\nH2. Logo evaluation will affect brand evaluations. Consequently, logo evaluation will mediate the effect of brand commitment and logo shape redesign on brand attitude.\n\nThe model underlying the two hypotheses is visually represented in Figure 1. To test these hypotheses, we conducted a study using athletic shoe brand logos. We conducted a series of pretests to validate that the selected brands exhibited a wide distribution of consumer commitment and that the survey participants would perceive the degree of change in the experimental stimuli as intended. The research design, measures, and results of these pretests are not presented here, but full results are available from the first author.\n\n6. Study\n\nThe study design featured a3 (degree of change: none, moderate, considerable) X 3 (commitment toward the brand: strong, moderate, weak) between-subjects design with commitment as a measured variable. We selected two brands of athletic shoes, Adidas and New Balance, based on past research (Ahluwalia et al., 2000) showing the brands are highly relevant to our sample of undergraduate students. A professional graphic designer modified the shape of the brand logos using two designs per logo: moderately redesigned and considerably redesigned. Pretests confirmed that respondents perceived the degree of change the designer intended. (Copies of the designs are available upon request from the first author). A total of 632 undergraduates at a large US university participated in the study for extra credit. Among them, 49 percent were males, and the average age was 21.86 years (SD = 3.41). Neither age nor gender were significant covariates in subsequent analyses and will not be discussed further. Measures included scales for brand commitment, brand attitude, and logo evaluation. (See Table I for full details on measures used in the study.) In terms of procedure, students were told they were participating in a study about athletic shoes. Each participant was given a booklet that showed the base logo. After viewing the logo, they completed the brand commitment scale and brand attitude scale (pre- redesigned logo exposure). This study measures brand attitude twice--before and after exposure to the logo design. This was done to measure the change in brand attitude awareness after exposure to the logo design. However, to avoid methodological issues with using difference scores (Edwards, 1995), post-exposure brand attitude was used as the dependent variable and pre-exposure brand attitude was included as a covariate in the model.\n\nNext, participants viewed the redesigned logo. Because this was a between-subjects factor, each participant saw only one version (no change, moderate change, considerable change) of the redesigned logo. Then respondents completed a brand- attitude scale (post-redesigned logo exposure). Finally, they provided demographic and product-ownership data.\n\n7. Results\n\nAn ANCOVA was conducted with brand attitude toward the post-redesigned logo as the dependent variable. The independent variables included brand commitment, degree of change, and their interaction. The covariates were brand, prior brand ownership, gender, age, and pre-exposure brand attitude. Including the brand and prior brand ownership ensured that consumers\' past associations were accounted for in the analysis. Similarly, pre-exposure brand attitude was included to ensure that any carryover effect of the brand exposure was accounted for. In other words, the observed effects can be attributed only to the change in the logo and consumer commitment to the brand.\n\nThe overall model was significant (F10,621=50.73,p<0.05), as was the effect of commitment (F1,630=173:23,p<0.05) and the effect of degree of change (F2,629=25.74,p<0.05). In support of H1, the commitment X degree of change interaction was statistically significant (F2, 629=42.63,p<0.05). As expected, pre- exposure brand attitude had a significant effect (F1,630=209.04,p<0.05). No other covariate was statistically significant. Results are shown in Table 2.\n\nRespondents were categorized as strongly, moderately, and weakly committed using a tertiary split (see Ahluwalia et al., 2000). The mean post-exposure brand attitude for each cell is shown in Figure 2. A post hoc test for a linear trend for strongly committed consumers was significant (F1,167=81.82,p<0.05). Results indicated that among strongly committed consumers, post-exposure brand attitude was not statistically different for the no-change and moderate- change conditions (Mnochange=2.77 vs Mmoderatechange=2.63 ; t =0.73, ns). However, post-exposure brand attitude for the moderate-change condition was significantly greater than that of the considerable-change condition (Mmoderatechange=2.63 vs Mconsiderablechange = 1.48; t=5.34,p<0.05), indicating that brand attitude declined as the degree of logo shape redesign increased.\n\nAmong weakly committed consumers, a test for a linear trend was statistically significant (F1,253=144.57, p<0.05). Specifically, among weakly committed consumers, post- exposure brand attitude for the no-change condition was significantly less than that of the moderate-change condition (Mnochange=3.15 vs Mmoderatechange= 3.86 ; t = 24.30,p < 0.05). Furthermore, post-exposure brand attitude for the moderate-change condition was significantly less than that of the considerable-change condition (Mmoderatechange = 3.86 vs Mconsiderablechange = 4.77; t = -5.16, p < 0.05). These results fully support H1.\n\nWe also compared cell means for strongly and weakly committed consumers within each degree of change condition. Among those in the no-change condition, the post-exposure brand attitude was relatively similar for weakly and strongly committed consumers (Mstrong = 2.77 vs Mweak = 3.15 ; t = -1.71,p > 0.05). The post-exposure brand attitude in the no-change condition for moderately committed consumers was significantly higher than both strongly (Mmoderate = 3.74 vs Mstrong = 2.77 ; t = 4.57, p > 0.05) and weakly committed consumers (Mmoderate = 3.74 vs Mweak = 3.15; t = 3.26, p < 0.05). For those in the moderate-change condition, the post-exposure brand attitude of strongly committed consumers was significantly less than that of weakly committed consumers (Mstrong = 2.63 vs Mweak = 3.86; t = -6.41, p > 0.05), as well as moderately committed consumers (Mstrong = 2.63 vs Mmoderate = 4.01; t = -6.89, p> 0.05).\n\nFor participants in the considerable-change condition, post-exposure brand attitude was significantly lower for strongly than for weakly committed consumers (Mstrong = 1.48 vs Mweak = 4.77; t = -16.87, p > 0:05), as expected. The post- exposure brand attitude of strongly committed consumers was also lower than that of moderately committed consumers in the considerable-change condition (Mstrong = 1.48 vs Mmoderate = 4.17 ; t = -13.61, p > 0.05). These means, shown in Figure 2, fully supported the hypothesized moderating effect.\n\nWe expected that logo evaluations would mediate the moderating effect of brand commitment on logo redesign on brand attitude. To examine this underlying process of mediated moderation, we conducted the regressions outlined in Muller et al. (2005). The interaction of brand commitment and logo condition had a significant effect on brand attitude (t = -14.31, p < 0:01), as indicated earlier. In the second regression, the interaction had a significant effect on logo evaluation (t = -17.71, p < 0.01). Importantly, in the third regression, the effect of the interaction on brand attitude was reduced (t = 23.24, p < 0.01), and the effect of logo evaluation was significant (t = 6.21, p < 0.01). The interaction of logo evaluation and brand commitment was also significant (t = -1.97, p = 0.05). These results indicate that logo evaluation mediates the moderating effect of brand commitment on logo redesign on brand attitude, supporting H2.\n\n8. Summary of Results\n\nConsumers who are strongly committed to a brand evaluate logo shape redesign more negatively and have a lower brand attitude. This effect occurs even after controlling for pre exposure brand attitude. Thus, the results presented here are a very conservative test of our hypotheses, as we fully control for preexisting brand attitude. Perhaps surprisingly, those with weak brand commitment have more positive brand attitudes toward the brand after they view a redesigned logo. Strongly committed consumers have significantly lower brand attitude than weakly committed consumers in both the moderate- and considerable-change conditions, but no difference is noticed in brand attitude when strongly committed consumers are exposed to the original, no- change brand logo.\n\nMediation analysis shows that evaluations of the logo itself partly drive brand attitude changes. The partial mediation through logo evaluation implies that changing the logo has broader consequences that affect brand attitude. In other words, logo evaluation is only one possible mediating mechanism.\n\nAlthough brand attitude between strong, moderate, and weakly committed respondents moves in the hypothesized direction (i.e. respondents\' brand attitude decreases for the strongly committed and increases for the weakly committed), it is counterintuitive for the initial brand attitude scores to be lower for strongly committed respondents compared with weakly committed respondents. Our study shows that brand commitment and brand attitude, while closely related, are separate constructs measuring different phenomena.\n\n[FIGURE 1 OMITTED]\n\n[FIGURE 2 OMITTED]\n\nReferences\n\nAaker, D.

List of measures used in studies\n\nMeasure\n\nDescription\n\nBrand\n\nBeatty et al.\'s (1988) brand commitment scale, comprising\n\ncommitment\n\nthe following three items, was used (1 = strongly\n\n\n\ndisagree, 9 = strongly agree): if (brand) were not\n\n\n\navailable, it would make little difference to me if I had\n\n\n\nto choose another brand (reverse scored); I consider\n\n\n\nmyself to be highly loyal to (brand); When another brand\n\n\n\nis on sale, I will generally purchase it rather than\n\n\n\n(brand) (reverse scored). The items had adequate internal\n\n\n\nreliability (Study 1: a = 0.88). The items were averaged\n\n\n\nto create a single measure. On this scale, higher scores\n\n\n\nindicate stronger brand commitment. We note that brand\n\n\n\ncommitment and brand attitude are significantly, but not\n\n\n\nhighly correlated (r2 = 0.0006, p < 0.001)\n\nBrand\n\nBrand attitude was measured using a four-item, semantic\n\nattitude\n\ndifferential scale developed by Ahluwalia et al. (2000).\n\n\n\nMeasured on a nine-point scale, the items are good/bad,\n\n\n\nbeneficial/harmful, desirable/undesirable, and\n\n\n\nnice/awful. The items displayed adequate internal\n\n\n\nconsistency for both the pre- and post-exposure brand\n\n\n\nattitude in both studies (apre = 0.93; apost = 0.96). The\n\n\n\nitems were averaged such that higher scores indicate more\n\n\n\nfavourable brand attitude. To avoid methodological issues\n\n\n\nwith using difference scores (Edwards, 1995),\n\n\n\npost-exposure brand attitude is used as the dependent\n\n\n\nvariable and pre-exposure brand attitude is included as a\n\n\n\ncovariate in the model\n\nLogo\n\nLogo evaluation was measured using the five-item rating\n\nevaluation\n\nscale developed by Henderson and Cote (1998). The five\n\n\n\nitems, each measured on a seven-point semantic\n\n\n\ndifferential scale, are: like/dislike, good/bad,\n\n\n\ndistinctive/not distinctive, interesting/not interesting,\n\n\n\nand high/low quality. The items had adequate internal\n\n\n\nreliability (a = 0.95) and were averaged to create a mean\n\n\n\nlogo evaluation score\n\nBrand\n\nThe brand is included as a covariate in the model (0 =\n\n\n\nAdidas, 1 = New Balance) since it is between-subjects\n\n\n\nvariable. We first ran the analysis including brand as an\n\n\n\ninteraction, but no interaction effects were found. It is\n\n\n\ntherefore included as a covariate\n\nOwnership\n\nRespondents indicated their usage of the studied athletic\n\n\n\nshoes. This variable was coded ""1"" if owned, ""0"" if never\n\n\n\nowned the brand whose logo they evaluated\n\n\nTable 2.

Cold outreach and prospecting was a daily hustle, and existing clients were practically hounded for referrals.\n\n\n\nThat daily grind quickly grew from a one-man operation into a small-time agency. Dylan Bozeman, the lead service provider and founder of the business, started to see room for growth. As a business, they began contracting work to freelancers of their own, hiring virtual assistants, and dreaming of a bigger and brighter future.\n\n\n\nSpecializing in various digital marketing services, they strived to provide what few agencies have managed to accomplish, providing genuine and continuous value to their clients. With advertising services like pay-per-click marketing as their forefront offering, that meant monthly auditing of client accounts, keyword research, ad copywriting, landing page design, and even conversion optimization by A/B split testing their pages. They set out to change the way businesses viewed managed PPC providers and to offer the type of value that their competitors couldn\'t.\n\n\n\nIt was a lot to provide under one roof and that responsibility grew even further as more services became cornerstones to their success.\n\n\n\nThe businesses they worked with often wanted to expand online through services such as display advertising, search engine marketing, and social media. These were all paid advertising models that delivered immediate results. However, as ads were optimized and improved, the profitability of the businesses they served increased, and suddenly, those same businesses were interested in other services as well.\n\n\n\nSuccessful ad campaigns often led to businesses inquiring about organic opportunities such as content marketing, SEO, and other forms of inbound lead generation.\n\n\n\nIt became apparent that a full-service agency was the only solution to helping these businesses get the most out of their digital marketing investments.\n\n\n\nHowever, this expansion of services came with unforeseen complications. Many businesses had trouble grasping the difference between online advertising and organic marketing. SEO and content marketing requiring thorough explanations and the hours of consultation that were needed to make this transition possible quickly began to overwhelm the sales team.\n\n\n\nEmpowermented was born with the goal of separating technical consulting from the services, by providing advanced consultation packages. These guides would thoroughly teach everything there is to know about digital marketing. The resources developed would also be categorized by their appropriate digital marketing model - SEO, PPC, content marketing, etc. This would effectively allow businesses to choose for themselves which model is right for their company and explore that topic to its depths.\n\n\n\nThrough classes and educational content, Empowermented\'s products provide the guidance and training that\'s needed for businesses to teach their marketing teams, or manage these areas on their own. Many businesses are looking for a better grasp of marketing concepts, but still want a team to manage their campaigns. The courses at Empowermented make that possible while decreasing the amount of live consultation needed to get a campaign off the ground.\n\n\n\nEmpowerment\'s founder, Dylan Bozeman, wanted a symbolic mascot for the new brand. What better than the gorilla, the most dominant animal of the jungle?\n\n\n\nGorillas are an undisputedly powerful great ape that are heavily-built and extremely large. They have incredible strength and an aggressive demeanor to match. Dylan felt their presence embodied the approach behind Empowermented\'s digital marketing services. He also recognized gorillas as a symbol for being an overwhelming contender in any operation or activity.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the gorilla\'s iconic presence that Dylan is hoping will command an influence for the brand, and represent their importance to the industry.\n\n\n\nIn his own words, Dylan acknowledged he\'s also a ""huge nerd and follower of paleontology. He\'s got a fascination for human evolution and its ancestral ties to other primates."" He confirmed that this alone is likely to have played a subconscious role in his decision to include the gorilla as the logo for the rebrand and the image behind their services.\n\n\n\nWith the business now officially located at Empowermented.com, there are many promising things on the horizon, and new guides expected shortly. Several previous brands of the business have been included in the rebrand, and these sites are said to be redirected appropriately. Over the coming weeks, expect Empowermented to be engaging with followers on social media and highlighting their exciting transition.\n\n\n\nMedia Contact\n\n\n\nCompany Name: Empowermented\n\n\n\nContact Person: Media Manager\n\n\n\nEmail: info@empowermented.com\n\n\n\nPhone: (206) 693-2639\n\n\n\nAddress:13110 NE 177th Pl #1007\n\n\n\nCity: Woodinville\n\n\n\nState: Washington\n\n\n\nCountry: United States\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://empowermented.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Distributed by M2 Communications (      \xc2\xa0    www.m2.com)) \n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Empowermented Launches Rebranded Digital Marketing Business Using Gorilla Mascot,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bb4d54f9-1794-41cd-8da3-2d222b7c6bfe&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5RCB-0S11-JD3Y-Y30B-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=162367&pdteaserkey=sr41&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr41&prid=ecf7130d-e2cd-475d-893a-34dc7c714dfc,2018-01-09,1.0

Image Credit: Fyber Berlin-based SponsorPay, a five-year-old mobile advertising technology company, is rebranding today as Fyber[1]. The new brand name fits with its mission of\xc2\xa0unifying the fragmented mobile ad ecosystem with a single ad management platform. \n\nFyber is a mobile supply-side platform which has created a platform that simplifies mobile advertising for mobile game and app developers. It provides a single dashboard that allows companies like Gree, Glu Mobile, and Cie Games to manage all of their ad networks with a single software development kit. With Fyber, developers can\xc2\xa0manage all of their ad networks at once. They can cut direct deals with ad networks and optimize their ad spending. The company will also help the mobile monetization industry consolidate so developers can have a one-stop shop for monetizing ads. In addition to the rebranding, the company is announcing it has grown to 180 employees and plans to add 70 more by year end, said Janis Zech, cofounder of Fyber, in an interview with\xc2\xa0VentureBeat. The core mission is still to integrate, manage and optimize all ad revenue sources through a single, unified platform in the $18 billion mobile ad revenue market. Fyber gives developers access to hundreds of demand sources and ad networks, including Facebook Audience Network, Google AdMob, Apple iAd, AdColony, InMobi, and more. Fyber tries to give developers a transparent view of those ad partners. In the past, developers had to integrate lots of ad networks and build their own user optimization strategy to determine what ad to show to certain users. Fyber unified that. 'The reason for the name change is that SponsorPay was known for being an optimized ad network, and now we are building significant new tools to address long-term problems for developers,' Zech said. 'We are excited about this new name and feel like it will reflect our effort to build a more sustainable and predictable revenue stream for app developers in a mobile ecosystem. The problems we are tackling are significantly larger.' The name reflects the thinking about unification as well as a play on 'fiber,' or a mainstay part of the human diet, Zech said. Every developer needs such nutrition, the company says. In the expansion, Zech said the company will triple the number of employees it has in its San Francisco office. It is staffing up to deal with current business as well as to deal with expansions into new businesses. 'We need to hire to tackle bigger problems, and we have seen significant revenue growth in the past 12 months,' Zech said. 'We want to complete the advertising technology stack.' 'The rebrand to Fyber is beyond just a new company name. We've been enhancing our product offerings over the past eighteen months, empowering our partners to discover and execute smarter ad monetization strategies,' said Andreas Bodczek, cofounder and CEO of Fyber, in a statement. 'It's our mission to unify the fragmented mobile advertising ecosystem and deliver pain-free experiences that grow our partners' revenue. Rebranding as Fyber is a natural evolution for our company as we work to define the future of connected advertising.' Over time, Fyber plans to offer more features and services that will help consolidate the industry. 'We don't support banner ads today, as an example,' Zech said. 'We will support them in the future. They don't work well in games now, but other kinds of apps use them.' Fyber reaches about 100 million users a month today, and it works with thousands of mobile developers and game makers. In the past quarter, the company saw a 250 percent increase in mediated revenue, and a 63 percent growth in new integrations. 'In\xc2\xa0this constantly evolving market,we are always looking to work with partners who offer tools that can help take our ad monetization strategies to the next level,' says Alex Rosen, vice president of product at Gree International. 'Fyber has tackled this issue head-on\xc2\xa0and their platform unifies the tools that a publisher needs to be successful. We look forward to seeing what the team at Fyber comes up with next.' SponsorPay was founded in 2009 with a focus on ads for browser-based games and Facebook games. Three years ago, it pivoted to mobile. And in the past couple of years, it has focused on the mobile supply-side platform. 'We've got a lot of new products coming in the next months,' Zech said. http://events.venturebeat.com/event/growthbeat2014/?utm_source=venturebeatutm_medium=boilerplateutm_content=toputm_campaign=growthbeat2014Our upcoming GrowthBeat event[2] \xe2\x80\x94 August 5-6 in San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 is exploring the data, apps, and science of successful marketing.

It's a question that's been asked a lot lately, especially with companies like Instagram, Uber, and Google drawing both ire and admiration from their new logo changes. We all have an opinion (some have strong opinions) on these changes, but no one really measures their effectiveness - which is what matters really. How do we answer the question: is your logo actually working?\n\n Some articles try to address the why behind the logo change, but no one talks about if the changes are working. We sought a more objective answer. Since we have the power of a visual engagement platform, we were able to break down the differences in brand recognition and recall, and see how logo changes affected perceptions. Regardless of how you feel about your favorite company's logo change, this article will breakdown original research on how the brands you know and trust are really performing. We conducted two experiments, which we'll refer to as (1) Logos Mixed in a Crowd and (2) Side by Side.Experiment 1: Logos Mixed in a CrowdFirst, we wanted to measure attention - essentially, which logos stand out from the crowd? So we placed ten recently-changed company logos in a grid (position randomized for each respondent to avoid placement bias[1]). The companies we analyzed were as follows: Twitter Foursquare Airbnb Uber Instagram Coors Light Paypal Google Facebook Yahoo! Here are the old logos: http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo1-1.jpg And the updated logos:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo2-1.jpgMethodologyWe started by showing one group of 100 people the new logotypes intermixed randomly and another group of 100 people the old logotypes. The logotypes were shown for ten seconds in a grid where the order of them was randomized (shown differently to each respondent) to avoid placement bias. By tracking people's gaze paths we can determine what they look at, in what order and for how long. That tells us what catches the most attention, and then we can calculate the average 'branding seconds' for each logotype. Branding Seconds is defined as the percentage of people who see the logotype multiplied with the average time they spend on it. This is a compound metric that shows how much attention the logo earns which is a predictor of likability. In previous Sticky study, we found that increasing[2] branding seconds 4x leads to a 1.7x increase in likability. Participants were then asked to list from memory the companies that they remembered, which tests brand recall. Participants were shown either the new logos or the old logos, but not both. The grid displayed for ten seconds to all participants. There are limitations to this methodology, as will be discussed below[3].ResultsYou can see all of the results from the 'grid experiment' here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo3-branding-seconds.png All new logotypes got more branding seconds than the old ones.The Biggest Winners of the StudyPayPal's new logo garnered 0.35 more branding seconds than its old logo, a 58% increase, and it also received the most overall attention at 0.91 branding seconds. Paypal ranked #1 both in amount improved and total branding seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paypal.png Uber ranked second in both total branding seconds and amount improved from its old logo, with an improvement of 54% from 0.61 to 0.94 seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-1.jpg While Google ranked seventh in total branding seconds with its new logo, it ranked third in amount improved. Its branding seconds increased 43%, increasing from 0.5 seconds with its old logo to 0.72 seconds with its new one.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google.jpg Foursquare's new logo clocked in at 0.86 seconds, up from 0.69 with a 26% gain.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/f.png Coors Light won big, as well, with 0.85 branding seconds at a 33% improvement from 0.64 to land in fourth place in both.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cl.png Twitter deserves a mention, too, tying Coors Light at 0.85 branding seconds, and improving by 21% against its old logo.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit.pngExperiment 2: Old vs. New Side by SideIn the second experiment, 100 people were shown the old and new logos side by side. The left/right positions were randomized to avoid placement bias and the logotypes were displayed for 5 seconds. This was to test whether the new or old logos garner more attention, which we can measure by tracking people's gaze paths. Let's see how each logo did Airbnb       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/airbnb-vs-air.png Side by side, the new Airbnb logo earned more attention than the old one. Coors Light       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/coors-vs-coors.png The old Coors Light logotype, with a focus on the bold typeface, got 0.7 more branding seconds. Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fb-vs-fb.png Facebook's new logo is a slight improvement on the old one, beating it by 0.2 seconds. Foursquare       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fs-vs-fs.png Foursquare's new logo received quite a bit less attention than the old one. Google       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/g-v-g.png Google's old logo earned more attention than the new one when placed side by side. Instagram       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ig-ig.png Looks like the haters were right: Instagram's old logo won by a decent amount, receiving .5 more branding seconds. The focus landed primarily on the text in the upper left-hand corner. PayPal       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pp-pp.png PayPal's updated logo is very slightly less attention gathering than the old one. Twitter       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit-vs-twit.png Twitter's new logo is a grand improvement with 133% more branding seconds compared to its old one. Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-vs-ube.png Uber's new logo had the same improvement as Twitter's new logo - a 133% increase in branding seconds. By the way, Uber's logo change - one of the most radical - received quite a bit of hate when it debuted. Yahoo!       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yahooooo.png Yahoo's new logo performed quite a bit worse. See all of the results here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/branding-seconds-2.pngTakeaways: What Matters?Some logos garnered more attention in the mixed crowd compared to the side by side test, like Coors Light, Paypal, Foursquare, and Google. But what does this actually mean? What does it mean that Twitter and Uber's new logos beat their old ones in terms of branding seconds and attracting attention from the crowd? What it comes down to is recall - will people remember seeing the logo, and upon remembering the logo, will they know the company? While brand recall from logotypes is just one aspect of a brand's image, analyzing brand recall is a useful metric because even if people spend hours looking at your logo, it doesn't mean anything unless they remember seeing it and remember which company it belongs to. In order to test brand recall, we asked the participants of the grid experiments to list which brands they remember seeing without any assistance. Again, participants were only shown either the old or the new logos in a grid, but not both. The results of the recall tests are below:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-one.png       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-two.png While, on average, the new logos were less able to be recalled than the old logos, some did better than others. Facebook, Google, and Twitter were the big winners in the recall test with unaided recall percentages above 15% for each of them. However, Facebook did the best because its recall percentage actually increased, from 20% to 21%. Google's went down, but only slightly, from 24% to 19%, and Twitter's actually decreased the most, from 51% to 24%. Twitter had the most room to spare though, with a 27% lead on its nearest competitor to the old logo, and it maintained its top spot. Coors Light deserves an honorable mention for keeping its recall percentage consistent at 11%. The biggest loser was Uber, with the lowest recall percentage at 2%, dropping from 14% for its old logo. Airbnb, Foursquare, and Instagram were all close behind at 4% recall. Paypal also deserves an honorable mention for dropping from 23% to 8%.Overall Biggest Winner and LoserBiggest Winner: Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-winner.png Even though Twitter had slightly better brand recall, Facebook's was the only one to improve with the new logo (Twitter's decreased by about half even though it kept the top spot). Facebook also experienced an 8% increase in branding seconds in the side by side test and an 18% improvement in the grid test. Biggest Loser: Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-loser-1.jpg Uber made great strides in both the grid test (increasing brand seconds by more than 50%) and the side-by-side test (increasing branding seconds more than 30%), but these improvements don't matter unless people recognize it as Uber's logo. Because Uber had the absolute lowest brand recall score at 2%, we know that they don't recognize the new logo as Uber's, so all the branding seconds Uber's been racking up are essentially useless. However, there is hope: As people use the app more and grow accustomed to the icon, they will surely begin to recognize it as Uber's. It would be interesting to run the test again in a few months to see if Uber's brand recall score improves.LimitationsThese experiments come with certain limitations, which we want to disclose upfront: In our set-up and analysis, we don't account for the brands strength (e.g. it's easier for most to remember Facebook than Uber). We didn't test the logos in a real life context. It's a 'competition' with other logos and they might work differently on say an ad or on a web page. We only tested two different versions of the logos. That makes it harder to understand what draws and holds attention compared to if we could test several radically different iterations of the logos. We tested the old logos side by side the new logos, which is a situation that hardly ever appears in the course of normal, daily life. Once a company changes their logo, they won't leave the old logos up as a comparison point. Because some of the companies had very similar results, it's hard to draw conclusions because the differences are within the margin of error, e.g. the difference between 2-4 or 45-50. Therefore, the results are indicative of a pattern but not hard and fast proof of any objective truth. It's a good starting point, but more studies should be done.ConclusionIn summary, companies that are looking to change their image shouldn't be afraid to start with their logo - every new logo did better in the crowd experiment compared to the old logos. However, there are a few things to keep in mind Initial brand recognition is important. Before any big logo change, it's necessary that people can recognize the old logo in order that the new logo holds any sort of sway or brand recall with the initial customer base. And, related to that point, in general it's best to keep logo changes grounded in the old logo. When changing the logo drastically, e.g. Uber, brand recall falls tremendously. If the new logo bears a basic resemblance to the old logo, people will still recognize the brand, as in the case of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Coors. Logo changes can be a great way to communicate internal change to the general public. If a company's culture, value or internal structure changes, it might be a good idea to change the logo as well.

In addition to re-branding the forecourt for all of its company-operated sites to Amoco, Coen plans to re-brand all of its stores to the Coen name by year\xe2\x80\x99s end or early 2021.\n\nThe rebranding includes all c-stores currently branded Ruff Creek Markets and CoGo\xe2\x80\x99s, which Coen acquired in December 2018.\n\nCharlie McIlvaine, Coen\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe reimaging of all of our stores to Coen and Amoco will enable us to speak with one voice to our guests in the region. The Coen-Amoco partnership offers distinctive products for our guests and is in line with our mission to \xe2\x80\x98impress and satisfy our guests with each visit and make their lives simpler.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCoen, which began serving customers in 1923, directly operates nearly 60 locations, including those with its CoenKitchen featuring a full breakfast menu, bean to cup coffee, Our Famous Chicken made from fresh, hand-breaded chicken, JoJos, from-scratch pizza and pepperoni rolls and an assortment of made-to-order sandwiches.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur CoenKitchen stores serve fresh-made, high quality and craveable food using the best ingredients. Our food offer has been a success with our guests. Similarly, we wanted to provide our guests with a high quality gasoline and fueling experience, which is why we chose to brand our stations with Amoco,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andy McIlvaine, Coen\xe2\x80\x99s president.\n\nAmoco is an iconic brand with a long history of quality fuels. The Amoco branding, image and station elements have all been updated after an almost 20-year hiatus, giving the recognizable torch and oval logo a more modern look. The brand had a commanding market position in the Pittsburgh tri-state region before bp acquired Amoco in 1998. Coen is among bp\xe2\x80\x99s oldest customers in North America.\n\nRob Moore, bp vice president sales mobility and convenience, Americas, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Coen-Amoco agreement is an example of how bp is enhancing its go-to-market efforts in North America. It is fitting that we embark on this landmark agreement with Coen, building on one of bp\xe2\x80\x99s longest relationships.

Naturally, it\'s very similar to the logo the Senators wore from 1992-97 when they returned to the league.\n\nAnthony LeBlanc, who was hired as president of business operations by owner Eugene Melnyk in March, has spent a lot of time working on a marketing rebrand. The work on this project started before his arrival, but the Senators want a fresh look for the 2020-21 campaign as their rebuild shifts into high gear with Ottawa holding three picks in the first round of next month\'s draft.\n\nFans appear to be thrilled to see the old logo return because the feedback so far has been positive.\n\n""It is time for the Senators to return to our roots,"" Melnyk said in a statement Friday morning. ""The fans of this great franchise have high expectations. We have heard from our fans, our partners and our players, and we have listened. It is time to return to our heritage, but in a bold, new manner. The Senators have a rich history in our community, and we are ready for the next chapter to begin.""\n\nThough, there has been no shortage of speculation about the logo through the summer, the Senators wanted to wait until after Labour Day before making the release official. The reality is with the Stanley Cup Final getting underway Saturday and the weather cooling off, there\'s more engagement with hockey now.\n\nThe logo replaces the modernized 3D version that was introduced during the 2007-08 campaign.\n\n""It\'s the start of a new chapter in the organization,"" LeBlanc told this newspaper in a telephone interview Friday afternoon.\n\n""I was talking to Eugene before I joined the organization and we talked about the fact that\'s it\'s going to be critically important that we reconnect and reconnect to our roots with the community.\n\n""When I was talking to him - and I really can\'t take any credit for this logo release because this was all done before I joined - this process was going forward. When I saw, not just the logo, but what we\'ll unveil on Oct. 6 with the entire jersey and reboot, it\'s pretty exciting.""\n\nThe players have seen the new look and they give it a passing grade.\n\n""What I liked the most was in talking to (GM) Pierre Dorion and hearing the players were behind this,"" he said.\n\n""It\'s all part of us focusing on that next chapter in the Senators history and what we think is going to be exciting."" bgarrioch@postmedia.com !@COPYRIGHT=\xc2\xa9 2020 Postmedia Network Inc.

Find out about using brand strategy and corporate identity design to rebrand your company.\n\nThe importance of your company's brand is as vital as a positive self-image. Shaping the identity of your company starts with your brand strategy and corporate identity design. In many cases when all might seem lost, a simple rebrand can be all that your company needs to give it the power of persuasion that might have been previously lacking. Think of a rebrand as a makeover for your corporate identity design and your chosen reputable group of brand strategists as the make-up artists. \n\n\n\nDeciding when to move towards a rebrand\n\n\n\nDeciding to rebrand your company is not something that should be taken lightly. When reviewing your brand strategy, you need to determine whether your corporate identity design is working for you and your company. If it is still representative of everything you stand for, if it's prominent and well known and it depicts the message you are trying to convey to the world, then it's probably best not to rebrand at this stage. \n\n\n\nA company that rebrands itself could also completely lose its identity in the process, so you need to make 100% sure that your company is in fact ready. Ask yourself these questions if you are unsure:\n\n\n\n\n\n- Is your company being classified incorrectly because of your current brand?\n\n- Is your brand completely dated, to the point where it is unappealing?\n\n- Are you looking to attract a new target market?\n\n- Have you introduced a new service that changes the effectiveness of your current brand?\n\n- Is your competition closing in and even overtaking you because your brand is not working for you anymore?\n\n- Has everything around your brand changed or been upgraded, leaving it isolated and disconnected to the rest of the company?\n\n\n\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions, then perhaps it's time you looked at a rebrand for your company and an overhaul of your corporate identity design. Consulting the services of specialists in this field will only assist in combining the right ingredients together for a rebrand that will capture attention. Make sure you choose a company that has worked on many successful cases with top-end clients. The team of brand strategists that you choose should also be able to detail exactly how they'll go about conducting your rebrand; from start to finish.\n\n\n\nRemember at all times that your brand is the true reflection of your business. It's the outer layer to your inner workings and the first thing someone sees when they come into contact with your company. You want it to pack some punch and you want people to remember it. If your brand isn't doing this for you then it is time for that makeover! \n\n\n\nContact WRAPPA Brand Consultancy today to give your brand a facelift! \n\n\n\nContact WRAPPA:\n\nWeb: www.wrappa.co.za\n\nMail: info&#64;wrappa&#46;co&#46;za \n\nPhone: 082 775 5191\n\n\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newsletter\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (97%); COMPANY STRATEGY (91%); NEW PRODUCTS (78%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (97%); GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES (90%); NEW PRODUCTS (78%); CONSULTING SERVICES (60%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0ABBY FINKENAUER (56%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0August 22, 2011\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",When should a company rebrand?,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=99952569-362d-48c5-90eb-a2291dbdffb6&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A53JR-GT11-DY06-805G-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=376638&pdteaserkey=sr68&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr68&prid=1c983520-4d60-42a5-9ba3-349a06c977e3,2011-08-15,0.0

To celebrate the milestone, the site has relaunched with a fresh identity, clean design and a new attitude. Dubbed Portugal Confidential Travel and Lifestyle, the content strategy is to engage an upscale audience with features on luxury hotels, fine dining, designer shopping, trendy bars, sophisticated living and more.\n\nLaunched a decade ago, PortugalConfidential.com was intended to explore Portugal through a contemporary cosmopolitan perspective. ""I had just relocated to Portugal from Los Angeles,"" explains American expat and Portugal Confidential founder Greg Boegner, ""I was interested in learning more about new boutique hotels, chic restaurants and popular bars and lounges. In the process, I discovered that no one was promoting Portugal in this way."" Hence, the brand Portugal Confidential was born with the tag line ""Everything Cool in Portugal.""\n\nThe reimagined Portugal Confidential Travel and Lifestyle retires the old tagline in exchange for a more elegant approach. ""With Portugal\'s recent economic growth, \'Everything cool in Portugal\' became a little too broad,"" says Boegner, ""we were trying to cover too much ground. Our new strategy streamlines the subject matter to appeal to the high-end consumer and traveller, a market that we see expanding in Portugal (before and after COVID restrictions are lifted, of course).""\n\nBesides a cleaner design, Portugal Confidential has implemented a number of new features. Users can now browse the site by key cities and regions, and search subcategories such as hotels, dining, shopping and nightlife. There are also Travel Guide landing pages, similar to micro-sites for key areas such as Lisbon, Porto, Alentejo, Algarve and Madeira. Additional landing pages for significant topics of interest such as Comporta and Avenida da Liberdade have been launched with more in development centering on Douro and Moving to Portugal.\n\n""We are very proud to reach this 10-year point,"" declares Boegner. ""We greatly appreciate all of the support we have received over the years from our partners, sponsors, contributors and readers. We look forward to 10 more exciting years.""\n\n#\n\nAbout Portugal Confidential\n\nBased in Vilamoura, in the Algarve, PortugalConfidential.com launched in 2010 as a contemporary alternative to travel and lifestyle websites featuring historic Portugal. Published in English, the site is visited by both Portuguese natives and expat residents, as well as international users interested in visiting or learning more about the country. In 2013, the subdomain Portugal Confidential Family went live, profiling activities suitable for parents and children. In 2014, Portugal Confidential LGBT debuted, providing content for the underserved gay market.

'We are pleased to have partnered with all of the major retail pharmacy chains and the majority of the Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBM) over the years and look forward to working with them and other industry leaders to forge the future of data analytics in the Pharmacy market.'\n\n\n\nThe company acquired Health Market Science in 2014, combining public records, claims and medical data with solutions tailored to pharmacies and PBMs, including VerifyRx, a real-time and compliance validation solution specifically for pharmacies and PBMs and Provider Data Masterfile, the industry-leading provider referential database of more than 8.5 million U.S. health care practitioners, including prescriber credentials.\n\n\n\n'The Pharmacy market, like the rest of the health care industry, is transforming; and big data technology is at the heart of that transformation,' said Craig Ford, Vice President of Sales, Pharmacy, LexisNexis Risk Solutions. 'LexisNexis Risk Solutions is ready to build on its heritage of quality provider data and lead the Pharmacy market through the maze of compliance requirements and into the brave new world of population health management and socio-economic data.'\n\n\n\nIn a market with an increasingly stringent and complex regulatory environment, pharmacies without the ability to perform real-time compliance checks put themselves at risk. By combining the industry-leading provider referential database with the company's public records footprint, analytics and big data technology, LexisNexis Risk Solutions can offer a continuum of prescriber data assets, analytics and services that allow pharmacy customers to remain compliant.\n\n\n\n'It's a good time for our brand to reflect what LexisNexis Risk Solutions brings to the Pharmacy market in terms of member and patient data assets, visualization, analytics and services that allows Pharmacy and PBM customers to increase member engagement,' said Dan Schofield, Director, Vertical Market, Health Care, LexisNexis Risk Solutions.\n\n\n\nNon-adherence to medication has been estimated to cost the health care industry $ 290 billion-1 per year, as patients seek hospitalization, expensive treatments or the emergency room for illnesses that could have been properly treated with medication. The combination of member and claims data, analytics and public records data with big data technology, enables pharmacists and PBMs to use socio-economic health attributes to predict and score the member's motivation to take medication and take ownership over their own care.\n\n\n\nAbout LexisNexis Risk Solutions\n\n\n\nLexisNexis Risk Solutions (http://www.lexisnexis.com/risk/) is a leader in providing essential information that helps customers across industries and government predict, assess and manage risk. Combining cutting-edge technology, unique data and advanced analytics, LexisNexis Risk Solutions provides products and services that address evolving client needs in the risk sector while upholding the highest standards of security and privacy.

""This feels like a homecoming; we\'ve had roots in Toronto, by way of Donnelly Group pubs such as Belfast Love, for half a decade. We fell in love with the Centretown community when we opened our original location there in 2019. To have the opportunity to not only introduce these communities to our new name, but also some new purpose-driven values layered onto our same great customer experience, that\'s really significant.""\n\nHobo Cannabis Company announced it would be rebranding to Dutch Love Cannabis earlier this week.

The initiative will donate 10 percent of proceeds from each new store\'s first operating month to a local community program that aligns with its values.\n\nAbout Dutch Love CannabisDutch Love Cannabis, formerly Hobo Cannabis Company, is a Donnelly Group venture and Canadian collection of 14 privately-owned retail cannabis stores with locations in B.C., Ontario, and Alberta.

The company has experienced strong growth over the last few years and today continues to develop and sell the market's preferred pediatric Zirconia crowns \xe2\x80\x94EZCrowns. Made from naturally occurring Zirconia,\xc2\xa0the revolutionary design of Sprig's EZCrowns functions and appears like natural teeth while offering the best retention and ease-of-seating in the industry. 'The rebrand represents our evolution as an organization from a crown company to a pediatric dental technology company,' said Sprig CEO Brenda Hansen. \n\n'The name Sprig signifies new growth. It truly illustrates our dedication to bringing innovation, fresh thinking, new products and educational offerings to pediatric dentistry. We believe the next generation should receive next generation care.' As parents are learning more, they are becoming increasingly concerned about the issue of biocompatibility \xe2\x80\x94 seeking products that are designed to be safer and healthier for their children. Sprig's products and materials are developed with a focus on biocompatibility. Through a combination of innovative products, education and unparalleled customer service, Sprig is providing dental professionals with the biocompatible technologies and techniques they need to grow their practices and deliver ever-better care to the most important patients: our kids. 'Our crowns and teaching programs are the best and most trusted in the industry, but as dentists, it is in our DNA to innovate \xe2\x80\x94 to do things better, faster, simpler, safer and smarter, while at the same time improving the quality of care for our patients,' said Sprig Co-founder Dr. Jeff Fisher. 'But there's still so much to do \xe2\x80\x94 so many products and techniques to be created or improved \xe2\x80\x94 and we are doing just that under the new Sprig brand.' As part of the rebrand, Sprig changed the name of its clinical education workshop program, formerly EZPEDO University (EZPU), to Sprig University[3] (Sprig U). Hosted at venues around the world and taught by a faculty of practicing dentists, the program helps dental professionals master the preparation and placement of pediatric Zirconia crowns, connect with new colleagues and learn new patient communication and marketing techniques that can help them grow their practices. Sprig also changed the name and scope of its magazine, formerly EZPEDO Magazine. The new Shift Magazine[4] is pediatric dentistry's only news and lifestyle publication and will take readers to the front lines of pediatric innovation. Released biannually, the magazine brings readers technical news and human-interest stories from around the industry, offering critical perspectives from dentists, patients and experts. 'All of these changes reflect our commitment to catalyzing innovation in our industry,' said Sprig Co-founder Dr. John Hansen. 'We're excited to continue working with our colleagues and our expanding customer base as we grow into the future as Sprig.' About Sprig Oral Health Technologies Sprig is pediatric dentistry's leading technology and clinical education company. Since creating the first pediatric Zirconia crown, Sprig has continued to develop new and better solutions, from patented crown design that maximizes mechanical retention to a custom bur system that optimizes seating.

We're not 110-year-old golfers.\n\n``I think they would have a very difficult time not changing the logo.''\n\nFaldo joined Ian Woosnam, Sam Torrance, Bernard Gallacher, Montgomerie and current captain Jose Maria Olazabal in flying to Ballesteros' home village.\n\n``I think you will find it does change and let's hope it is sooner rather than later,'' said Montgomerie outside the church in Pedrena where so many came to pay their respects.\n\n``I would vote for that immediately. When you talk about the European Tour you talk about Seve and I think it's only right he should appear on our logo.''\n\nMontgomerie described the funeral service as ``very sad and moving, but after this mournful day we have to start to celebrate his life.''\n\nFaldo added: ``There will never be another Seve. He had everything - the good looks, the charisma, the smile, the walk and the swashbuckling golf game.\n\n``We shared lots of battles and it's tragic. We would have been mates and we've lost out on that.

There are logos that have been deliberately untouched, like Coca-Cola\'s[1]. Then there are brands that have constantly changed their look, from Pepsi to Microsoft Windows to Starbucks. Visit Business Insider\'s homepage for more stories.[2] Most logo changes by big brands are subtle. \n\n Think Coca-Cola \xe2\x80\x94 since the 1880s, its logo design has barely evolved[3]. The Coca-Cola logo is ubiquitous and consistent, and it pays off: Coca-Cola is widely regarded as the most recognized brand worldwide. Some, however, are so drastic that they look as if they\'ve been created for completely different companies. It can be risky to redesign a major logo, but many big brands are still willing to take the plunge. It doesn\'t always end well. Clothing retailer Gap, for example, changed its logo in 2010, then reverted back to the old design[4] just days after serious customer backlash.Here are the most drastic logo redesigns in brand history. IBM IBMWhen it came to design, the latter half of the 20th century marked a time of simplification[5]. IBM\'s logo evolution reflects this trend \xe2\x80\x94 its current design dates back to 1972. It\'s meant to evoke ""speed and dynamism,"" according to IBM\'s website[6].Pepsi PepsiPepsi represents the path that many brands have taken \xe2\x80\x94 phasing out lettering entirely until all that remains in a logo is the symbol itself. Pepsi\'s first logo[7] is illustrative of the design emphasis of the late 19th century. The more intricate a design, the better. In 1962, Pepsi introduced its sans serif logo that eventually inspired its current redesign.Volkswagen VWAdolf Hitler is often credited for designing an early version[8] of the iconic VW Beetle. The pre-WWII logo for the car manufacturer bears Hitler\'s influence as well, a swastika-like symbol clearly outlining the letters. VW dropped the shape in 1939 for a cleaner design that resembled teeth on a gear[9]. That design eventually became today\'s button-like logo. The blue color wasn\'t added until 1967, and Volkswagen has barely changed its look since.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[10] See Also: The best and worst Easter eggs and hidden meanings in 20 company logos[11]13 things Trump\'s trade war could make more expensive for American parents, from strollers to sports gear[12]From San Diego to Austin and Seattle, these are the 15 best US cities to launch a startup[13] SEE ALSO:The best and worst Easter eggs and hidden meanings in 20 company logos[14] [ 1]: https://www.coca-colacompany.com/au/news/trace-the-130-year-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-logo.html [ 2]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner [ 3]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.coca-colacompany.com/au/news/trace-the-130-year-evolution-of-the-coca-cola-logo.html [ 4]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/oct/12/gap-logo-redesign [ 5]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/logo/logo_5.html [ 6]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.ibm.com/ibm/history/exhibits/logo/logo_8.html [ 7]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pepsi-logo-timeline_n_2279676 [ 8]:       \xc2\xa0    https://medium.com/content-shailee/evolution-of-the-volkswagen-logo-25fe01229f2f [ 9]:       \xc2\xa0    https://medium.com/content-shailee/evolution-of-the-volkswagen-logo-25fe01229f2f [ 10]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/shocking-drastic-logo-changes-2013-4?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner#/#amazon-4 [ 11]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/the-easter-eggs-and-hidden-meanings-in-company-logos-2019-6?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner [ 12]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-trade-war-parents-cost-groceries-strollers-2019-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner [ 13]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/the-best-cities-for-startups-2019-7?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner [ 14]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.businessinsider.com/the-easter-eggs-and-hidden-meanings-in-company-logos-2019-6?utm_source=partner..._medium=newstex..._term=original..._campaign=partner \n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0English\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Blog\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa0BZIN-5352\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRAND EQUITY (90%); BRANDING (90%); REBRANDING (90%); TRENDS (78%); SPORTING GOODS (70%); TRENDS & EVENTS (70%); WORLD WAR II (66%); Features, Slideshows, Logo, Design, Branding, (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 STARBUCKS CORP (93%);  COCA-COLA CO (92%);  GAP INC (69%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0SBUX (NASDAQ) (93%); KO (NYSE) (92%); GPS (NYSE) (69%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS722515 SNACK & NONALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE BARS (93%); SIC5812 EATING PLACES (93%); NAICS312111 SOFT DRINK MANUFACTURING (92%); SIC2086 BOTTLED & CANNED SOFT DRINKS & CARBONATED WATER (92%); NAICS448140 FAMILY CLOTHING STORES (69%); SIC5651 FAMILY CLOTHING STORES (69%); GENERAL CLOTHING STORES (92%); SOFT DRINKS (91%); BEVERAGE PRODUCTS (90%); BOTTLED WATER (90%); BRAND EQUITY (90%); BRANDING (90%); CLOTHING & ACCESSORIES STORES (90%); MANUFACTURING (90%); REBRANDING (90%); RESTAURANTS (90%); RESTAURANTS & FOOD SERVICE INDUSTRY (90%); SOFT DRINK INDUSTRY (90%); BEVERAGE MFG (89%); SOFT DRINK MFG (89%); RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADE (78%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (75%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (75%); RETAILERS (75%); SPORTING GOODS (70%); AUTOMAKERS (61%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED STATES (70%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0July 15, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'","From the Amazon arrow to the Starbucks mermaid, here are the 15 most drastic logo changes in brandin.docx",,,0.0

She discusses the impact on companies\' rebranding efforts to become racially sensitive.\n\nWhy have the brand images for Aunt Jemima, Uncle Ben\'s and Mrs. Butterworth\'s endured for decades?\n\nThe compelling and enduring theme emerges right after the devastation of the Civil War. The myth goes that Aunt Jemima, an enslaved cook, made famously fluffy pancakes that won over Confederate generals and plantation masters alike. But mostly she, Uncle Ben and other degrading images were created in order to reassure white southern aristocrats that newly freed African Americans would remain subservient and at the bottom of the racial hierarchy.\n\nSince the Civil War, we have spent a lot of money on the mammy archetype that Aunt Jemima typifies. She has been in films and on television (South Park\'s ""Gluten Free Ebola"" episode), used to season food from salt shakers made in her image, and her face has adorned clocks, tea towels and collectable spoons. It\'s important to understand Aunt Jemima existed in this world where she was as popular as Ronald McDonald is today. And that her popularity was based in the reality of plantation slavery.\n\nA family member and historian of Lillian Richards, the original Aunt Jemima spokesperson, released a statement pushing back against the rebranding. How do companies balance between doing what is right (changing an offensive logo) vs. maintaining the logos\' heritage?\n\nAs her family pointed out, Lillian Richards used her skills and talents to make a good, decent living at a time when those opportunities were few for Black women. Women like Nancy Green and others whose names are lost to history have embodied the mammy role like Aunt Jemima for audiences across the country. But the reality of these early innovators of food entertainment is that their motivations and impact are overshadowed by the simpler story a symbol like mammy portrays. We certainly cannot forget that these jobs literally sold the experience for many American families and built a lasting Quaker Oats brand.\n\nThe decades-long debate to eliminate stereotypical images does not need to conflict with discussing these family histories and interpreting them in an ethical way so the story is not so incomplete in the future. Instead of focusing on the fairly normal strategy of rebranding, this is also an opportunity for companies to examine their role in creating the \'decent\' living that Lillian Richards and other women of color searched for. Aunt Jemima mix is made in part by the labor of incarcerated people, and in the food industry, women of color are often the most underpaid worker. Removing Aunt Jemima from the box is the first of many steps in redressing the larger inequalities these images signify.\n\nWhat is the relationship between these ""mammy"" and Jim Crow-era stereotypes and the foods they represent?\n\nThese, like other branding images, have a really crucial role to the products they appear on. They help the consumer connect the product to an imagined memory or experience. This means that even though we know that a pound of ground meat came from a processing plant, the image of a joyful pig on a bountiful farm distracts us from this reality. Aunt Jemima is aimed to evoke a feeling of unmatched domestic comfort through the mammy stereotype. However, this reinforces an association where African American women can only be seen or understood through this stereotype. In terms of the food item itself, pancakes might vaguely signal the mythical baking of some plantation cooks, but it\'s fairly ubiquitous in the United States and, importantly, only takes a few commonly held ingredients.\n\nOther food companies have announced similar rebranding. Land O\'Lakes is removing the illustration of a Native American woman from its labeling, and Dreyer\'s Grand Ice Cream, which owns Eskimo Pie, has announced similar rebranding due to the derogatory history of its name. Do you see a common history amongst other racial stereotypes in food branding?\n\nSimilar to racist logos with sports teams, all of these brands share the common history of objectifying people of color in the marketing of consumer goods. Our culture is saturated with these images and they accumulate until they become fully fledged assumptions and misunderstandings.\n\nWhat will it take for these rebranding efforts to be successful?\n\nIf the motivation behind these changes is to reckon with hundreds of years of profit from Black and brown labor and stereotypes, then a successful rebrand might simultaneously address larger inequalities in our food system.

CenturyLink comes with better than a 9% current dividend yield, and some investors have wondered just how sustainable that $1.00 per share payout will be in hard times. Now CenturyLink is trying a new twist for itself with a name change and rebranding to Lumen Technologies.While name changes are not really anything new, the release concerning Lumen also noted that the company has a bold new purpose. According to its press release, the new rebranded company will help 'lead enterprises through the challenges and opportunities of the 4th Industrial Revolution - a time when smart, connective devices are everywhere.' The release also indicates that Lumen 'brings a new focus to how it views the marketplace and the world with the purpose to further human progress through technology.'This move might make sense to some investors. To others, it may seem like a street game of three-card monte.CenturyLink has explained that the 4th Industrial Revolution represents the latest technological shift to change how everyone lives, works and thrives. Whether this company wants to be known as Lumen or CenturyLink, the company's current business offerings already include IP and data services, including VPN data network, Ethernet, internet protocol (IP), content delivery services, high bandwidth optical networks, unlit optical fiber networks, private line services, colocation and data center service, voice and collaboration services, satellite television, hosting, public and private cloud, IT services and so on.CenturyLink is no stranger to growing its operations and making acquisitions that involve multiple names over time. The company acquired Level 3 Communications back in 2017 that gave the company (by its own press release) a pro forma revenue of $24 billion for the trailing 12 months ending June 30, 2017. CenturyLink's annual revenues were $23.4 billion in 2018 and $22.4 billion at the end of 2019. The current Refinitiv consensus analyst targets call for revenues of $20.65 billion in 2020 and $20 billion in 2021.If this is such a major directional change, perhaps there would be more changes to the long-term corporate outlook. That's not the case here. CenturyLink's press release stated: The company does not intend to change its financial strategy or financial reporting as a result of this announcement. Effective with the opening of the trading day on Sept. 18, 2020, the company stock ticker will change from 'CTL' to 'LUMN.' CenturyLink has sold some of the assets that came with the Level 3 acquisition, but the company has a history of making smaller acquisitions. Some of the smaller purchases in recent years included the following: SEAL Consulting (SAP solutions), netAura (security services), ElasticBox (multi-cloud application management services), Orchestrate (database-as-a-service) and DataGarden (disaster recovery.CenturyLink already has changed its name over time. CenturyLink agreed to acquire Qwest Communications a decade ago, and Qwest dates back to the 1980s break-up of the old AT&#38;T into the regional Bells via a Qwest merger with U.S. West. In 2009, the old CenturyTel acquired Embarq Corporation in a tax-free stock merger to create another one of the top U.S. communications companies, along with a revamped name of CenturyLink.Lumen President and CEO Jeff Storey commented on new brand name and new purpose: Our people are dedicated to furthering human progress through technology. Lumen is all about enabling the amazing potential of our customers, by utilizing our technology platform, our people, and our relationships with customers and partners. Lumen's press release also talks up many of the buzzwords around the 4th Industrial Revolution: smart cities, retail and industrial robotics, real-time virtual collaboration, automated factories, high-performance networking and security, a highly interconnected global fiber network infrastructure, edge cloud capabilities and so on. This begs the question whether most of those aren't targeted already.In all fairness to the company, and to offer up both sides of a story here, a Denver Post article on the Lumen rebranding does specify that the move highlights a push to offer more digital services[3] directly to large customers. That article noted that the new name and brand is the result of a bunch of small acquisitions rather than being due to one large acquisition. Denver is a key hub for CenturyLink/Lumen, and the company has roughly 5,800 of its 40,000 employees based there.Another report from News Star in Monroe, Louisiana, where CenturyLink is based, shows that the headquarters will remain in Monroe[4]. Roughly 1,800 of its 40,000 employees are based in Louisiana.As for CenturyLink's dividend history, the current quarterly dividend is $0.25 per share. The quote pages and the investor relations site show a $0.54 quarterly dividend back in 2018, and it was a $0.725 quarterly dividend until the first payment in 2013.If things were going to be vastly different, perhaps investors could have expected an update to guidance. CenturyLink's stock was above $40 back in 2010 to 2012, and while it got back to $40 briefly in 2014, the trajectory of the shares has been lower in the years since. It's now a $10.85 stock, with a 52-week trading range of $8.16 to $15.30, and the reaction to the name change and rebranding was rewarded with a two-cent drop in the shares as of midday trading. Refinitiv's consensus target price was last seen at $9.66.The reasoning of some name changes and rebranding efforts are very obvious. Whether this effort is as obvious is up to the company to prove going forward.  24/7 Wall St. Jefferies Top Growth Stocks to Buy Include 4 Red-Hot Health Care Companies https://247wallst.com/healthcare-business/2020/09/15/jefferies-top-growth-stocks-to-buy-include-4-red-hot-health-care-companies/ ; A 10-year stock chart from BigCharts.com has been provided below.

The name Rainbows was used for the first time by reporters following the final game of the 1923 season, an upset victory over Oregon State after which a rainbow appeared over the field.\n\nThe school's nickname was changed to Rainbow Warriors in the mid-1960s after the student newspaper ridiculed the name Rainbows and linked it to homosexuals.\n\nNow the school may be walking into another minefield by going with just ''Warriors.''\n\nMany college and professional teams including baseball's Cleveland Indians and football's Washington Redskins have been pressured to change their Indian-related names and mascots.\n\nJonathan Osorio, an associate professor at the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies, said he personally has no problem with the name Warriors since it's used by many cultures and isn't specific to one group of people.\n\nBut he said some Hawaiian students believe the nickname improperly co-opts a piece of their culture.\n\n''We feel powerless about how these symbols are used. When they appear as ridiculous or burlesqued images, there's nothing we can do about it,'' said Osorio, a Native Hawaiian. ''It feels like they're making fun of our culture.''\n\n For 77 years, the rainbow has been the symbol and nickname for the University of Hawaii football team, with the rallying cry, ''Go 'Bows!''\n\nMore recently, the rainbow has become a symbol for gay and lesbian pride, which the school's athletic director said was a factor in the decision to drop the rainbow from school logos and the football team's nickname.

''We remain committed to our policies on diversity and inclusiveness.''\n\nFootball coach June Jones did not return telephone calls Friday seeking comment. It was Jones who pushed for the logo and name changes along with well-known agent Leigh Steinberg, who was hired by the school to market the athletic program.\n\nUniversity President Kenneth Mortimer is on vacation and unavailable to comment, a spokesman said Friday.\n\nYoshida and other officials said the university's rainbow led to confusion with the Rev. Jesse Jackson's National Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, a group promoting the idea of people working through their differences to come together.\n\n''Our intent was to illustrate that the rainbow and rainbow logos are associated with a wide array of entities and causes,'' Yoshida said in Friday's statement. ''Our new identity is intended to be unique to Hawaii and to University of Hawaii athletics.''\n\nInstead of avoiding the issue, the university has a responsibility to confront it directly, said Jon Davidson, an attorney in Los Angeles with the Lambda Defense Fund gay rights group.\n\n''What the university needs to understand is they have a problem and they should do something about the problem, rather than say we are going to have students make fun of students who are perceived to be gay, so we'll make sure no students are perceived to be gay,'' Davidson said.\n\nHawaii was known as the Fighting Deans during its first football game in 1909. The name Rainbows was used for the first time by reporters following the final game of the 1923 season, a 7-0 upset of Oregon State that was followed by rainbow appearing over the field.\n\nManoa Valley, where the university is located, also is well-known for its rainbows. The state has since included one on its license plates.\n\nThe school's nickname was changed to Rainbow Warriors in the mid-1960s after the student newspaper ridiculed the name Rainbows and linked it to homosexuals.\n\nYet the rainbow in Hawaiian culture is a symbol of power and hope, and therefore made a good logo for a team called the Warriors, said Jonathan Osorio, associate professor at the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies.\n\nThe rainbow symbolizes the presence of ali'i, or Hawaiian chiefs, and the locations of a chief's birthplace or a sacred site.\n\nTo see a rainbow was to know the ali'i were looking over their people, Osorio said.\n\n''As far as I was concerned, a rainbow was a perfectly appropriate symbol,'' said Osorio, a Native Hawaiian.\n\nThe school has also walked into a minefield by choosing the nickname ''Warriors.''\n\nMany college and professional teams including baseball's Cleveland Indians and football's Washington Redskins have been pressured to change their Indian-related names and mascots.\n\nSome universities have changed nicknames in recent years, including the Marquette Warriors, who became the Golden Eagles, and the St. John's Redmen, who are now the Red Storm.\n\n For 77 years, the rainbow has been the symbol and nickname for the University of Hawaii football team, spurred on by the rallying cry, ''Go 'Bows!''\n\nMore recently, the rainbow has become a symbol for gay and lesbian pride, which the school's athletics director said was a factor in a decision to drop the rainbow from school logos and the football team's name.\n\n''That logo really put a stigma on our program at times in regards to it's part of the gay community, their flags and so forth,'' Hugh Yoshida said after the new, Polynesian-style ''H'' logo was unveiled this week, replacing the old logo, which had the letters UH and a rainbow.\n\nNow the university is being accused of homophobia by gay and lesbian groups and being criticized by some Native Hawaiians for renaming the football team the Warriors.\n\n''A statement like that I can understand coming from student-athletes, but to come from the athletic director, I am surprised and disappointed,'' said Ken Miller of the Gay and Lesbian Community Center.\n\nYoshida, who earlier said his comments were taken out of context, issued a statement Friday apologizing to anyone he may have offended.\n\n''I understand why some people might consider some of the comments to be derogatory, even if no harm was intended,'' Yoshida said.

In turn, fans of said team look to the booze to bask in their team's glory, while those who support the loser tend to attack the bottle for the exact opposite reason. \n\nHappiness, sadness, basketball, and booze \xe2\x80\x94 the four golden pillars of the chase for the title. Now, we're not suggesting this is the way it should be; we're just merely calling it like we see it. Therefore, if the connection is already there, why not just fuse them into one? Lucky for you, someone took the time to do just that. And it's glorious. Just as he did when he turned NBA logos into Nintendo games[3], graphic artist Mark Avery Kenny[4] used his skills to redesign NBA logos in another completely original way, turning beer and basketball into a superb 'N Beer A' series. Once again, this guy shows us that he has serious game, and after looking over each and every one these creations, we have to admit, we have some favorites. For us, in the world of NBA logos reimagined as beer brands, these five are nothing but net.1. Houston Rockets N Beer A Series - Rocket Stripe[5] A photo posted by AK (@ak47_studios) on Apr 16, 2016 at 2:09pm PDTThe Houston Rockets\xc2\xa0may have failed to get off the ground this season, but this logo redesign is absolutely out of this world. Since we have nothing but good things to say about Red Stripe (Hooray Beer!), there's no reason why we shouldn't get behind 'Rocket Stripe.' Plus this product would be a great sendoff for Dwight Howard, you know, for when he ultimately takes his talents to a galaxy far, far away[6] next season.\xc2\xa02. Toronto Raptors N Beer A Series - Raps Blue Ribbon #wethenorth[7] A photo posted by AK (@ak47_studios) on Apr 23, 2016 at 11:47am PDTFor all you Toronto fans out there struggling to watch an NBA Finals that doesn't feature your beloved Raptors, perhaps you should drown your sorrows with a nice, refreshing can of 'Raps Blue Ribbon.' It's not the fanciest brew on the market, but when your team can't get over the hump, it will be there to cheer you up with its excellent wordplay and creative use of a raptor clawing a basketball. Trust us, you'll feel hip(ster) in no time.3. Milwaukee Bucks N Beer A Series - Old Milwaukee Bucks[8] A photo posted by AK (@ak47_studios) on Apr 24, 2016 at 11:50am PDTThis redesign is just too perfect for words. Seriously, it's as if the Milwaukee Bucks \xe2\x80\x94 and their logo \xe2\x80\x94 were born to be reimagined as Old Milwaukee. Granted, some may knock this creation for being a little too obvious, but we don't see it that way. It's simple, unthreatening, and doesn't force the issue \xe2\x80\x94 kind of like the Bucks themselves. We bet the Milwaukee faithful wish they had some of this at their disposal right about now.4. Cleveland Cavaliers N Beer A Series - Cavalier Extra[9] A photo posted by AK (@ak47_studios) on Apr 20, 2016 at 8:01am PDTThe Cleveland Cavaliers may have been overmatched in Game 1 of the NBA Finals[10], but this logo interpretation can stand up against the best of them. Whether you're reaching for a Corona or hoping to take the edge off with a 'Cavalier Extra,' just let your worries drift away. Your beach is out there, and you'll find it. Even if you happen to live in Cleveland.5. Miami Heat N Beer A Series - Miami Hot Top[11] A photo posted by AK (@ak47_studios) on Apr 27, 2016 at 9:36am PDTThis redesign is so good, it's on fire. The Miami Heat logo fuses perfectly with that of Shock Top. The basketball, the shades, the flames, everything is hot, hot, hot. Are we using too many 'Heat' references? Probably.

A drive towards higher production values, smaller inventory and reduction of publisher risk, along with the environmental advantages of producing on-shore, were at the heart of the strategy, the firm said.\n\nA new system upgrade, which includes the latest iX30200 HD inkjet press from Canon, complements two existing continuously-fed inkjet presses which now flow into a fully automated finishing line, delivering a completed book within hours.\n\nIn addition, five colour toner and cover embellishments for short-run lengths have been added. The investment increases capacity and combines the workflows for shortrun digital and print-ondemand production.\n\nTJ Books, which employs more than 120 people, is also introducing a new management information system which will go live at the end of the year.\n\nThis will streamline the front end of the business, giving customers greater visibility and live information about their orders.\n\nThe company, founded in 1969, underwent a management buyout led by managing director Andy Watts in 2018.\n\nSince then it has gone through a series of structural changes to ensure a thriving business despite the big uncertainties of Brexit and Covid-19.\n\nTJ Books is today led by Mr Watts, finance director Andy Adams and sales director Andy Vosper.\n\nMr Watts said: ""These past two years have been an important time to ensure we have laid key infrastructure to support the strategy.\n\n""Our decision to buy this business and then relaunch as TJ Books was born from a desire to offer an innovative and refreshing approach to the market. Our new brand represents the company that we are today and what we are experts at - books.\n\n""Our new fresh, dynamic and modern website not only showcases what we do here in Cornwall; it also portrays our unique personality within the trade and the personality of the people in our eclectic team here at TJ Books,"" added Mr Watts.\n\nOur new brand represents the company that we are today and what we are experts at - books Andy Watts, managing director\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nTJ International in Padstow has rebranded into TJ Books and undergone a \xc2\xa31.5m investment\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newspaper\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa0WBR\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (91%); BRANDING (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (88%); EXECUTIVES (86%); BREXIT (73%); BUSINESS SOFTWARE (69%); MANAGEMENT BUYOUTS (63%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0PRINTING INDUSTRY (91%); REBRANDING (91%); BRANDING (89%); MANUFACTURING (78%); BUSINESS SOFTWARE (69%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED KINGDOM (58%); National Edition\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 10, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Rebranded printing company set for new growth after £1.5m investment,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=51db45d9-ceea-4237-8c59-4ba884e04b31&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60T6-W841-JCBW-N4WY-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=370514&pdteaserkey=sr1&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr1&prid=8ab92546-c4e0-4bc0-b0a8-72244d974b1e,2020-09-10,1.0

It also has slightly softer colours.\n\n""As you\'ll see, we\'ve taken the Google logo and branding, which were originally built for a single desktop browser page, and updated them for a world of seamless computing across an endless number of devices and different kinds of inputs (such as tap, type and talk),"" the company wrote in its blogpost announcing the change.\n\n The new logo has already appeared on the homepage, with a little animation that wipes away the old logo and replaces it with the new one.\n\nThe change doesn\'t seem to be related to the company\'s re-organisation, which saw what used to be called Google changed into Alphabet. Though it is the first major change announced since then, Google\'s statement made no reference to the change and instead discussed the importance of shrinking the text for legibility on all kinds of screens.\n\nBut it does bring the look of Google in line with the more simple design of Alphabet.\n\nMuch more of Google\'s branding will be changed to match the new logo, it said. That included the little G that pops up when users click on the small microphone that Google sometimes shows.\n\nGoogle noted that it had changed its logo multiple times over the last 17 years, and that it would be likely to change again. But it said the new change recast the logo ""not just for the Google of today, but for the Google of the future"".\n\nIn 2014, Google revealed a new logo that involved moving the second g slightly to the right.

It's pretty colorful, and will definitely stand out in your app drawer now. \n\nAlong with the main Instagram app, the company redesigned the logos of their other apps, which include Layout, Boomerang and Hyperlapse. All three match the Instagram logo, a bit - although they have a bit less color. According to Instagram's blog post today, the new logo is 'inspired by the previous app icon' and it 'represents a simpler camera and the rainbow lives on in gradient form'. This is Instagram's first big change in their logo in their five-year history, and it's going to have a mixed response as logo redesigns typically do. In their blog post, the company also touts that there are 80 million videos and pictures shared each and every day. The new logo isn't all that Instagram has for us today. The company is also launching redesigned apps for Android and iOS. While they are redesigned a bit, they do work the same as they always have. The design is more simple now, at least according to Instagram. You'll see that the bottom bar, which houses your profile, notifications, home feed, and a few other buttons, have changed from a gray color (with the camera being blue) to being completely white with black icons. The reason behind this change to the design of the apps, again according to Instagram, is to put more focus on the photos and videos that are shared each day on the service. App updates are rolling out today on both Android and iOS that reflect these changes. They don't appear to be available just yet, but they should be in a few hours. The APK for the Android version hasn't yet hit the web, but it should be coming pretty soon. This is a pretty big update for Instagram. While they did change the design of the app on Android and it still looks similar to the iPhone version, it isn't just an 'iOS rip-off'.

We're not 110-year-old golfers.\n\n``I think they would have a very difficult time not changing the logo.''\n\nFaldo joined Ian Woosnam, Sam Torrance, Bernard Gallacher, Montgomerie and current captain Jose Maria Olazabal in flying to Ballesteros' home village.\n\n``I think you will find it does change and let's hope it is sooner rather than later,'' said Montgomerie outside the church in Pedrena where so many came to pay their respects.\n\n``I would vote for that immediately. When you talk about the European Tour you talk about Seve and I think it's only right he should appear on our logo.''\n\nMontgomerie described the funeral service as ``very sad and moving, but after this mournful day we have to start to celebrate his life.''\n\nFaldo added: ``There will never be another Seve. He had everything - the good looks, the charisma, the smile, the walk and the swashbuckling golf game.\n\n``We shared lots of battles and it's tragic. We would have been mates and we've lost out on that. We always had mutual respect, but we never realised the level of feelings that we had for each other.''\n\nYoungsters dressed in navy blue and each carrying a three-iron, plus the Pedrena rowing team with raised oars, provided an escort to the church service.\n\nIt was with a rusty three-iron that Ballesteros first became hooked on golf at the age of seven, hitting stones on the beach near his home in Pedrena.\n\nAnd it was in navy blue that many of his most memorable victories came, the best of them all his second Open Championship victory at St Andrews in 1984.\n\nA photograph of Ballesteros that day, fist-pumping in sheer jubilation after his closing birdie putt, was placed alongside the urn carrying his ashes for the service at the church of San Pedro de Pedrena.\n\nThe urn had been brought to the church by a procession led by a piper, then his three children Baldomero, Miguel and Carmen and his older brothers Manuel, Vicente and Baldomero - all of whom became golf professionals as well.\n\nBallesteros' final wish was for the funeral to take place in a familiar setting, open to everyone, and he said he wanted to be treated ``like any other neighbour'' during the ceremony.\n\nAfterwards the ashes were taken back to his house and placed next to the magnolia tree he had chosen as his final resting place.\n\nA shrine has started outside the family home, with candles, notes, a pair of golf shoes and even a three-iron being left as tributes.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newswire\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0DEATHS & OBITUARIES (90%); GOLF (90%); GOLF TOURNAMENTS (90%); ATHLETES (76%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (76%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (76%); ROWING (67%); EXECUTIVES (56%); GOLF Ballesteros Logo (%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0EUROPE (73%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0May 12, 2011\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",LEGENDS CALL FOR LOGO CHANGE TO HONOUR SEVE.docx,,,0.0

But that\'s the trouble with white privilege - any sort of privilege - we don\'t think until it\'s brought to our attention.\n\nIn the United States, the term ""uncle"" has unpleasant racial undertones, as patronising as ""boy"", so it\'s baffling that the offensive name and imagery managed to hang on as long as it did.\n\nRobinson\'s infamous golly (can I even say that\xe2\x80\xa6?) was first subject to a boycott in 1983, which saw the logo moved to the back of the jar then dropped entirely in 1988.\n\nI have met one or two people who were bothered by this. My friend mildly dismisses her octogenarian father\'s continued dismay with the catch-all ""he\'s at that age when parents turn racist, what can you do?"" When it comes to pulling down Bristolian statues, renaming Plymouth squares or National Trust angst over magnificent piles built on slavery, I literally haven\'t got the reserves of indignation I once had to draw upon. Put up an explanatory plaque. Sorted.\n\nNot good enough for my husband. For weeks now, he has attempted to get me aerated about the cancel culture that has seen Edinburgh University\'s David Hume Tower morph into 40 George Square.\n\nHume may have been a genius of the Scottish Enlightenment, but his deeply chauvinistic opinions on the superiority of white men drew criticism even in 1753, when he wrote about the inferiority of other races. Now his really very ugly tower (home to the German department where I spent much of my university life) is no more his, I don\'t care.\n\nI lived through the Eighties when it was fashionable to rename parks, lanes and student unions after Nelson Mandela, then an incarcerated freedom fighter. It was incongruous but symbolic and, above all, it was about changing the present, not the past, and setting an agenda to the future.\n\nSo let them overhaul Uncle Ben\'s rice with my blessing - as long as Aunt Bessie\'s Yorkshire puddings aren\'t next.\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nOverhaul: the Uncle Ben\'s branding had \'unpleasant racial undertones\'\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newspaper\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa0DTL\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (91%); BRANDING (90%); SHAMING (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (78%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); RACE & ETHNICITY (78%); RACISM & XENOPHOBIA (78%); STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS (78%); MEN (77%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (64%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (91%); BRANDING (90%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (64%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0NELSON MANDELA (52%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0EDINBURGH, SCOTLAND (54%); UNITED STATES (79%); SCOTLAND (69%); National Edition\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 25, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Cancel culture' demands that rice be rebranded - but I won't be stirred,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=9cd3f934-73e9-4c02-825b-ba588c7aa322&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60XD-3D21-JCBW-N4B9-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8109&pdteaserkey=sr114&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr114&prid=4e333249-fe91-4ed1-8177-d52ab38e3c0e,2020-09-25,1.0

The name, AppIt Ventures remains the same, however, the company may now also be referred to as just ""AppIt.""\n\nSince AppIt\'s inception in 2009, the company has built over 500 applications and custom software products for Startups, Enterprises, and Fortune 500 Companies. The rebranding project began in the early stages of the COVID-19 Pandemic of 2020 and coincided with an interesting economic time frame that left companies all over the world in pursuit of creative and sustainable ways to address the needs of a quickly changing marketplace.\n\nThe rebrand has enabled AppIt to refresh its entire image with a clean, modern feel that is similar to the products that the company develops for their clients. The new AppIt website acts as a hub of resources for business owners who want to get started with custom software development or building an app.\n\n""AppIt\'s rebrand is a huge step in our company\'s 10+ year evolution. It showcases not just what we do, how we do it, who we serve, and who we are, but how first and foremost, as designers and developers, we focus on creating world-class user experiences. A company\'s brand and website should be their best foot forward. I\'m proud to say that we are finally there as a company, but we\'ll never stop innovating, updating, and storytelling,"" said Amanda Moriuchi, CEO of AppIt.\n\nAppIt\'s new image including their new brand colors, logo, and website was developed in-house, through a collaborative process involving the leadership team, the marketing team, the design team, and the development team--discover, design, develop, deploy. Their 4 step process and department-wide teamwork are reflective of AppIt\'s niche for taking high level ideas and recreating them in custom software.\n\nThe new website offers users a clean and engaging design with a highly intuitive navigation.

At the time, the business operated under the direction of a lone freelancer as a sole proprietorship. It started how most online service providers begin their journey, by using job boards, online freelance communities, forums, and networking with local businesses. In other words, leads were sought in any and every way imaginable. Cold outreach and prospecting was a daily hustle, and existing clients were practically hounded for referrals. \n\nThat daily grind quickly grew from a one-man operation into a small-time agency. Dylan Bozeman, the lead service provider and founder of the business, started to see room for growth. As a business, they began contracting work to freelancers of their own, hiring virtual assistants, and dreaming of a bigger and brighter future. Specializing in various digital marketing services, they strived to provide what few agencies have managed to accomplish, providing genuine and continuous value to their clients. With advertising services like pay-per-click marketing as their forefront offering, that meant monthly auditing of client accounts, keyword research, ad copywriting, landing page design, and even conversion optimization by A/B split testing their pages. They set out to change the way businesses viewed managed PPC providers and to offer the type of value that their competitors couldn't. It was a lot to provide under one roof and that responsibility grew even further as more services became cornerstones to their success. The businesses they worked with often wanted to expand online through services such as display advertising, search engine marketing, and social media. These were all paid advertising models that delivered immediate results. However, as ads were optimized and improved, the profitability of the businesses they served increased, and suddenly, those same businesses were interested in other services as well. Successful ad campaigns often led to businesses inquiring about organic opportunities such as content marketing, SEO, and other forms of inbound lead generation. It became apparent that a full-service agency was the only solution to helping these businesses get the most out of their digital marketing investments. However, this expansion of services came with unforeseen complications. Many businesses had trouble grasping the difference between online advertising and organic marketing. SEO and content marketing requiring thorough explanations and the hours of consultation that were needed to make this transition possible quickly began to overwhelm the sales team. was born with the goal of separating technical consulting from the services, by providing advanced consultation packages. These guides would thoroughly teach everything there is to know about digital marketing. The resources developed would also be categorized by their appropriate digital marketing model SEO, PPC, content marketing, etc. This would effectively allow businesses to choose for themselves which model is right for their company and explore that topic to its depths. Through classes and educational content, Empowermented's products provide the guidance and training that's needed for businesses to teach their marketing teams, or manage these areas on their own. Many businesses are looking for a better grasp of marketing concepts, but still want a team to manage their campaigns. The courses at Empowermented make that possible while decreasing the amount of live consultation needed to get a campaign off the ground. Empowerment's founder, Dylan Bozeman, wanted a symbolic mascot for the new brand. What better than the gorilla, the most dominant animal of the jungle? Gorillas are an undisputedly powerful great ape that are heavily-built and extremely large. They have incredible strength and an aggressive demeanor to match. Dylan felt their presence embodied the approach behind Empowermented's digital marketing services. He also recognized gorillas as a symbol for being an overwhelming contender in any operation or activity. It's the gorilla's iconic presence that Dylan is hoping will command an influence for the brand, and represent their importance to the industry. In his own words, Dylan acknowledged he's also a 'huge nerd and follower of paleontology. He's got a fascination for human evolution and its ancestral ties to other primates. He confirmed that this alone is likely to have played a subconscious role in his decision to include the gorilla as the logo for the rebrand and the image behind their services. With the business now officially located at, there are many promising things on the horizon, and new guides expected shortly. Several previous brands of the business have been included in the rebrand, and these sites are said to be redirected appropriately. Over the coming weeks, expect to be engaging with followers on social media and highlighting their exciting transition.

It was clear we needed to tell the world that we are a different Ashland with our transformation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Luis Fernandez-Moreno, senior vice president of Ashland and president of the Chemicals Group, in an interview with ICIS.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are 100% focused on specialty chemicals, and our people and technologies enable us to provide solutions to customers to help improve their products\xe2\x80\x99 usability, efficacy, allure, integrity and profitability. We call these the five Ashland Effects,\xe2\x80\x9d Fernandez-Moreno added. The new Ashland has a unique combination of technologies \xe2\x80\x93 in cellulosics, vinyl pyrrolidones, acrylates, polyurethanes and bio-functionals, said the executive.\n\nAnd this set of competencies allows it to provide solutions to key markets in personal care, pharmaceuticals, coatings and adhesives, automotive and construction materials, as well as nutrition, food and beverage and composites, he noted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cAll of our businesses have a strategy for understanding their customers. It is very different servicing a pharmaceutical company, providing products that preserve the integrity or quality, than creating a composite for a boat. But our goal is to help our customers improve their profitability,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fernandez-Moreno.\n\nAshland\xe2\x80\x99s specialty ingredients segment, which comprises cellulose ethers, vinyl pyrrolidones and biofunctionals, generated sales of $2.1bn and adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) of $478m in the 12 months through June 2016. This translates to an EBITDA margin of 22.8%.\n\nAshland\xe2\x80\x99s performance materials segment includes unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) and vinyl ester resins. It has two divisions \xe2\x80\x93 composites and intermediates/solvents. This segment generated sales of $1.0bn and EBITDA of $133m in the same period. The EBITDA margin of 13.8% was much lower compared to the specialty ingredients segment.\n\nOn 23 September, Ashland separated its Valvoline lubricants and automotive chemicals business in an IPO.\n\nFOUNDATIONAL BUSINESSES\n\nWithin Ashland\xe2\x80\x99s performance materials, its butanediol (BDO), maleic anhydride (MA) and UPR businesses are not specialties, but considered \xe2\x80\x9cfoundational\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 providing reliable low-cost supply for downstream businesses, he noted.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe produce a lot more BDO than what we need for internal use. In the future, this business could be subject to a different strategic perspective. However, we are comfortable and very happy with our current portfolio,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fernandez-Moreno.\n\nAround one-quarter of Ashland\xe2\x80\x99s BDO production is consumed internally, with much of it going into vinyl pyrrolidones. The rest is sold on the merchant market, he said.\n\nAshland has two BDO plants \xe2\x80\x93 one in Lima, Ohio, with 65,000 tonnes/year of capacity, and one in Marl, Germany, with 100,000 tonnes/year of capacity, according to the ICIS plants and projects database.\n\nFor maleic anhydride, the vast majority of Ashland\xe2\x80\x99s production is consumed internally for UPR. While Ashland sells some maleic anhydride on the merchant market, it is a net purchaser, as its needs vary depending on geography. Ashland has 54,500 tonnes/year of maleic anhydride capacity at its plant in Neal, West Virginia, according to the ICIS plants and projects database.\n\nM&A STRATEGY\n\nAs a pure-play specialty chemical company, Ashland is seeking mergers and acquisitions (M&A) opportunities to complement its technologies and build out geographically.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are always looking and have a pipeline of opportunities that could enhance our capability to provide solutions to our core or niche market segments. We look for complementary technologies as well as geographic expansion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fernandez-Moreno.\n\nHowever, he maintains that Ashland remains \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly disciplined\xe2\x80\x9d when it comes to M&A, even in today\xe2\x80\x99s hot deal mar ket.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith current deal multiples, it is a tough task to make a strategic acquisition that will drive shareholder value,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fernandez-Moreno.\n\nThe highest priority for M&A efforts will be in core businesses where Ashland already has robust product lines such as personal care, pharmaceuticals and coatings. That is followed by niche businesses such as nutrition, adhesives, and food and beverage, where it can find complementary products. M&A will be \xe2\x80\x9cless likely\xe2\x80\x9d in foundational businesses, he said.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is an exciting time for our company, which is focused on specialty chemicals. It allows us to be more operationally focused and present our new brand to provide solutions to customers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Fernandez-Moreno.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are 100% focused on\n\nspecialty chemicals, and\n\nour people and technologies\n\nenable us to provide\n\nsolutions to customers\n\nLUIS fernandez-moreno\n\nPresident of the Chemicals Group, Ashland\n\nXxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nPic credit\n\nAshland\xe2\x80\x99s acrylic functional components improves the quality of paints\n\nAshland\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe produce a lot more\n\nBDO than what we need for\n\ninternal use.

""For consumers who are highly committed to the brand, the logo represents a visual conduit that enables a customer to identify with the brand. Our studies have shown that highly committed consumers also have very high levels of brand attachment. As such, any changes to the brand conduit -- the logo -- are seen as a violation of the psychological contract between the brand and the consumer.""\n\nStarbucks dropped both its name and the word ""coffee"" from its 40-year-old logo as the Seattle-based coffee chain prepares to triple its locations in China from about 400 to 1,500.\n\nIn one of his studies, Mittal found that companies that changed their logo design were most likely to estrange their most committed customers. A second study found that when angular logos were changed to rounded logos, they were more acceptable in interdependent and collectivist cultures -- often found in Asian countries, such as India and China -- than in Western countries, which tend to have a more independent or individualistic culture.\n\n""It is important for companies to refresh their logos, but the process of doing so must be carefully managed,"" said Mittal. ""Our research shows that companies need to carefully consult customers -- whether through Internet sites or chat rooms -- to ensure that customers feel they have been heard in the redesign and repositioning process. That will ensure that highly committed customers -- who are also often the heaviest consumers of the brand -- feel connected to the brand.""\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newswire\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0CONSUMERS (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); RESEARCH REPORTS (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (71%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (71%); PSYCHOLOGY (71%); CHAT ROOMS (61%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 STARBUCKS CORP (93%)\n\n\n\nOrganization:\xc2\xa0NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONVENIENCE STORES (84%); RICE UNIVERSITY (84%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0SBUX (NASDAQ) (93%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0COFFEE & TEA (90%); COFFEE & TEA STORES (90%); CONVENIENCE STORES (78%); RETAILERS (78%); COFFEE (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (71%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (71%); PSYCHOLOGY (71%); CHAT ROOMS (61%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0SEATTLE, WA, USA (79%); WASHINGTON, USA (79%); CHINA (92%); INDIA (79%); ASIA (79%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 10, 2011\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",RESEARCH SHOWS STARBUCKS' LOGO REDESIGN COULD BENEFIT COMPANY.docx,,,0.0

It can be subtle, like how Bing changed its logo color from yellow to green[1].Or it could be bolder, like the new IHOP logo.But changing a logo can be a double-edged sword. On one hand, a logo update can be the perfect way to launch a rebranding effort and stay relevant. On the other hand, the refresh may be poorly executed or end up irking your customers. \n\nThe key, then, is proper timing. Below are a few indicators to help you figure out if it's time to update your logo for a rebrand and what you should consider when choosing it as the reason for your logo change.1. Your Logo Is OldPerhaps the most common reason businesses update their logo is because of age. Ask yourself: When was your logo first introduced to the public? If it has been updated before, when? A logo, along with a tagline, is often the single biggest identifier for a business. And like any identifier, these things just don't stick around forever. Your logo is a marketing tool in and of itself, so at some point it will have to be revitalized. The question, however, is how. As many brands have learned, this undertaking can be rife with mistakes. Consider Gap's much-maligned logo refresh[2].While there's always a good chance that some people won't be pleased by a logo update, what Gap did wrong, at least according to many designers, is replace an iconic logo with a forgettable one. The choice of Helvetica (a typeface more than five decades old) as the font, for example, didn't do the clothing company any favors either. It didn't help either that Gap executives responded to the backlash by attempting to crowdsource logo ideas, which only made the rebranding decision look clumsy, if not foolish. The lesson here is that if you're going to update a logo because of its age, it should be new and make sense. Google's logo update, a simple evolution from a serif to a sans serif typeface, is a good example of this. 2. Your Logo Looks DatedNote that a logo that's old and a logo that looks dated are two different things. The Twining's logo, for example, still looks perfectly acceptable today, despite it being more than a century old.A dated logo, on the other hand, is usually one that looks like it was clearly inspired by designs or styles that were trendy at the time. Consider Instagram's old logo, which was inspired by skeuomorphism\xe2\x80\x94designs that imitate real-life objects. In Instagram's case, the logo took inspiration from the old Instamatic cameras of our youth. Skeuomorphic design, however, eventually went out of style and was replaced by Flat Design. And so, the Instagram logo evolved and was inspired by flat designs favored by both the iOS and Android operating systems.In Instagram's case, the evolution of its logo came at a time when mobile phones were also moving to flat interfaces[3], so the refresh was a matter of keeping up or looking dated. Business owners should take note of this. If your logo is beginning to appear stale or out of place with your competitors, a sensible refresh may be in order.3. There's Too Much Happening in Your LogoNot-so-good-looking logos are a common problem with small businesses. Oftentimes, small business owners either design their logos on their own or micromanage the design process, which can lead to a muddled logo that only confused the public. If your logo looks like it has too many things going on at the same time, replacing it with a cleaner, simpler version may work wonders. Here's an example of a logo that has too many visual elements competing with one another.While the logo looks it was professionally done, it still too busy, with too many details vying for your attention. It ignores one of the fundamental rules of graphic design: simplicity. Indeed, less is often more, especially when you consider where your logo will appear. It's a given that your logo will appear on your website. But how will look it look when it's smaller? Think of letterheads, stationary, and business cards? Will the logo still be readable? Remember, the more complicated your logo is, the harder it will be to remember. Think of the most iconic logos out there and take note of how simple yet striking they are. Again, less is more. 4. Your Company Is Going Through ChangesAnother common reason organizations change their logos is due to dramatic changes happening to the company. This can include mergers, acquisitions, restructuring, or a pivot to a new direction. It's major events like these that can benefit from a major rebranding effort, which is where a new logo comes in. For example, the merger of food companies Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz in 2015 was marked by the unveiling of a new logo[4]. Sure, the difference may not have been significant, but it's still a new logo showing the merger of two companies.On the other hand, Mastercard's decision to take the text out of its logo[5] came at a time when the company acknowledged that the future of cashless payments is 100 percent digital, so the logo was as much as statement as it was a subtle pivot into uncharted territory.The takeaway here is that if your business is undergoing changes, a new logo may help set the tone and direction of your company moving forward. This benefits not just your customers, but also your internal stakeholders as well.Is Now the Right Time for a Logo Change?Whether you want to revamp your image, breathe new life into your brand, or simply make a statement about the direction and future of your company, a rebranding effort and logo update can be instrumental in grabbing the attention of both old and new customers. Use these best practices as a guide when deciding whether now is the time for this effort. When you're ready, be sure to work with a skilled graphic designer to bring your vision to reality.

MTS, Russia\'s top mobile phone operator, was ranked 89th, making it the first and only Russian brand to appear in the top 100. LUKoil came in eighth on the list of the top 10 international motor fuel brands and Baltika beer was ranked 15th out of the top 20 beer brands worldwide.\n\nThe rankings are compiled by comparing a company\'s earnings, based on its country of origin and market position, with the earnings that come from the company\'s most loyal customers, which can be attributed to the brand itself.\n\nThe ranking shows how much MTS has benefited from its 2006 rebranding, which was widely considered a failure initially. The rebranding of MTS was part of a larger effort by its parent company, Sistema, to develop a recognizable look that would connect all its products -- mobile phones, Internet, digital television and land line services. The company paid Omnicom Group\'s Wolff Olins consultancy $4 million to develop the brand, which consists of a white egg surrounded by a solid-colored square. The square is a different color for each product. MTS was represented by a white egg in a red square -- a brand the company later discovered was also the logo of the Inskaya Poultry Farm in the Kemerovo region.\n\nThe problems with the new MTS brand were not limited to possible challenges of copyright infringement, however. It was also considered inferior to the new brand of rival Beeline, whose rebranding effort in 2005 was largely seen as one of Russia\'s most successful.\n\nYekaterina Osadchaya, a spokeswoman for Beeline\'s parent company, VimpelCom, said the company\'s new brand -- which features the black and yellow stripes of a bee -- achieved the goal of the rebranding effort: instilling in public consciousness the principles of clarity, simplicity and optimism.\n\n""A successful brand must take on a life of its own,"" Osadchaya said.\n\nBut Osadchaya acknowledged that it was always easy to lose sight of the aims of rebranding, because a company\'s image is complicated and all-encompassing.\n\nMaxim Stulov / VedomostiMTS\'s new logo is similar to the Inskaya Poultry Farm\'s.\n\nOsadchaya\'s comments reflect a common misconception among Russian companies about rebranding.\n\n""Rebranding is not a mere change of name or logo. It is a complete change of corporate values, promises, attitudes and feelings about brands and products,"" said Yelena Georgobiani, a rebranding consultant at media company SPN Ogilvy.\n\nGeorgobiani said Russia was caught up in a rebranding fever. ""In the past, companies celebrating their 10th or 15th anniversary tried to rebrand, but now every company wants to put on a new face.""\n\nGeorgobiani characterized this as a tendency to wrongly equate the unveiling of new names and symbols alone with rebranding by companies eager to take part in the trend. Additionally, in a country where property ownership remains remarkably fluid and hostile takeovers common, efforts characterized as rebranding sometimes simply reflect new ownership.\n\nFresh on the heels of an initial public offering in May, Dixy, a leading retailer of foodstuffs and household supplies, was eager to plow part of the $360 million it recouped into a rebranding campaign, even if the company\'s idea of rebranding was hazy at best.\n\nDixy evolved from three regional points of growth -- Moscow in the central region, St. Petersburg in the northwest and Yekaterinburg in the Urals --and has been using a different brand to promote its image in different regions. The company presently sports a bright red logo in the Urals, a yellow one in the central region and a blue one in the northwest.\n\n""Our marketing experts were working to bring all our company symbols to a new, unified standard,"" said Yaroslav Grekov, Dixy\'s head of public relations. ""This, of course, means that in some regions we will be rebranding our stores and in other regions, we won\'t.""\n\nThat effort had to be shelved after a takeover bid by the Mercury Group in December. The company hopes that its new owners will approve the rebranding strategy, but at the moment, the plan is on hold.\n\nRebranding does not protect a company from problems such as unpaid tax claims or the prying eyes of law enforcement agencies.\n\nEldorado, a leading electronics retailer whose head office was raided earlier this month, said it was doing all it could to keep its brand name intact, even as authorities press tax-evasion charges.\n\n""Our company\'s market research since the raid showed that the our brand is still popular with 90 percent of the population,"" said Ilya Novokhatsky, Eldorado\'s communications manager.\n\n""Rebranding is too expensive and time-consuming and we have no intention of doing it just because we are having a hard time,"" Novokhatsky said.\n\n""As long as clients have brand names and attributes that are completely unique and individual, there can never be a conflict of interest.""\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newspaper\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); MINING & EXTRACTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); PARENT COMPANIES (89%); COPYRIGHT (79%); COMPANY NAME CHANGES (78%); COMPANY EARNINGS (77%); RANKINGS (77%); COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT (74%); ANNIVERSARIES (60%); EMOTIONS (60%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 OMNICOM GROUP INC (84%);  OAO LUKOIL (58%);  VIMPELCOM LTD (58%);  WOLFF OLINS LTD (55%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0OMC (NYSE) (84%); LKOH (RTS) (58%); LKOD (LSE) (58%); VIP (NASDAQ) (58%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS541820 PUBLIC RELATIONS AGENCIES (84%); NAICS541810 ADVERTISING AGENCIES (84%); NAICS541613 MARKETING CONSULTING SERVICES (84%); NAICS211111 CRUDE PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (58%); SIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM & NATURAL GAS (58%); SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS (58%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING AGENCIES (92%); NATURAL GAS PRODUCTS (91%); WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (91%); BRANDING (90%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING SERVICES (90%); MINING & EXTRACTION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); NATURAL GAS (90%); OIL & GAS INDUSTRY (90%); PETROLEUM & COAL PRODUCTS MFG (90%); PETROLEUM PRODUCTS (90%); CONSULTING SERVICES (89%); POULTRY (89%); PUBLIC RELATIONS (89%); ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY (78%); BEER & ALE (78%); MEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS (78%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (77%); NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION (77%); TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT (77%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (72%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (72%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (71%); ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES (70%); DIGITAL TELEVISION (52%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0MOSCOW, RUSSIAN FEDERATION (73%); RUSSIAN FEDERATION (92%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0April 27, 2008\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Rebranding Puts Russian Firms on World Stage,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=14a6ff6f-dc03-4726-8da0-f469232d8d03&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4SCN-1VH0-TX7H-N0DT-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=145252&pdteaserkey=sr159&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr159&prid=d8fe1293-602d-44d5-98f4-31a70bb23801,2008-04-28,0.0

We take great pride in developing and translating different chemicals to market applications that when implemented for the client have a net positive effect for their business, safety, and environment.\n\nResultThe Q2 image leans forward into opportunities, providing clients with sound solutions to bring their projects to the next level.

Our new visual imagery, based on guiding style of the logo, embodies a bright, clean, and fresh look which is implemented throughout the site.

All Rights Reserved\n\nSection:\xc2\xa0CALGARY BUSINESS; Pg. D2; Around Town\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0708 words\n\nByline:\xc2\xa0David Parker, For the Calgary Herald\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nBack in 1987, when Mike Taylor established Heritage Office Furnishings, it was an appropriate name for the company that opened in a north east Calgary location to supply a wide range of furniture. But the industry has changed considerably to the point that president and CEO Taylor has rebranded his company as HBI -Heritage Business Interiors; a full-service dealer of quality business furniture and architectural interior products.\n\nTen years ago success initiated a move to larger premises in 30,000 square feet along Fisher Road S.E. plus a 19,000-square-foot warehouse in Valleyfield.\n\nNow it is planning to move again into an office/ showroom in Portland Place, just off Blackfoot Trail, that will allow HBI to be consolidated under one roof in a more centralized location closer to its downtown clients.\n\nSpanning over two floors the space is being reconfigured by Sizeland Evans Interior Design to attract the architectural and design community, not only to showcase HBI's innovative product solutions but to be utilized as a design resource for A&D firms.\n\nDorian Zubko, HBI vice-president of sales and operations is leading the project team in partnership with Andrea Freeman and Mavis Truscott of Sizeland Evans and Tammy Colville, project manager for Labbe Leach Interiors that is responsible for construction management.\n\nZubko holds a Masters in Environmental Design degree from the University of Calgary and began his working career designing water parks before joining Evans Consoles. He made the move to HBI five years ago to help clients work more effectively by allowing freedom of design.\n\nPortland Place will have a showroom with 30-foot ceilings and a working library. It offers the ability for designers to access samples, catalogues, and the Internet through an Interactive Media Technology platform, a touch-screen technology with video and voice conference calling capabilities for easy collaboration on projects.\n\nTaylor and his wife Cindi, HBI's CFO, have grown the company to a staff of 40 that is the exclusive dealership for Haworth Office Furniture from Red Deer south, supplying furniture, movable walls and raised floors. It boasts long-term contracts to major firms such as WestJet, ATB Financial throughout Alberta, and Enterprise Rent-A-Car across the country.\n\nToday its staff is being kept very busy delivering and installing the furniture for the Calgary Board of Education's new tower on 8th Street S.W.\n\nThis week, Green Calgary, a non-profit urban environmental organization that has been empowering Calgarians to create healthy homes and communities since 1978, welcomes Michael Ireton as its new executive director.\n\nExperienced in building sustainable residential homes as a LEED Accredited Professional he has a passion for sustainability and community building. Most recently he held the position of executive director of the South Calgary Community Association and he has been heavily involved in a number of local community initiatives.\n\nGreen Calgary closed its Eco-store thanks to the availability today of many of its products at mainstream retailers and recently, with the help of Marl Kolke of MaxComm Realty Advisors, moved into new office space on 14th Street N.W.\n\nIreton will be just settled in ready for the Green Calgary annual rain barrel and composter sale that take place on May 14 at Crowfoot and Anderson LRT Stations and at IKEA.\n\nEngineering, mining and oil and gas professionals who fancy a life down-under can attend an opportunities expo on Saturday and Sunday being held at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.\n\nThe expo will provide a platform to meet with Australia's leading employers in their field-including BHP Hilton, Caltex Australia, Origin Energy and Rio Tinto -to interview, hire and offer sponsorships. Professional seminars will also be held to enable attendees to learn more about employment opportunities in exciting projects and living in and the T process of moving to Australia.\n\nAfter four years with Grosvenor America's office in Calgary, Jaydan Tait has joined Brookfield Properties in a new role as general manager, Calgary In-Fill.\n\nDAVID PARKER APPEARS TUESDAY, THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

The name change, which is effective immediately, is accompanied by a rebranding initiative that reinforces the company\'s mission to help clients in the onshore oil & gas and mining industries make faster, more informed decisions about where to explore, lease, and drill. By simultaneously integrating multiple geological, geophysical, and geochemical measurements, NEOS\'s solutions provide natural resource companies with critical insights into what portions of a basin, claim stake, or lease are most prospective for hydrocarbon and mineral exploration.\n\nJim Hollis, President and CEO of NEOS, commented on the rebranding, ""We came to believe that our prior brand didn\'t reflect our company\'s total focus on providing geoscience solutions that help explorationists to quickly and cost-effectively monetize their resource holdings. I believe the name NEOS GeoSolutions better conveys our intent to provide high value, technology-enabled insights so our clients can make better decisions about what acreage to lease and where to drill within it.""\n\nAccording to Chris Friedemann, NEOS\'s Chief Marketing Officer, ""The name NEOS was chosen because it brings together two words of Greek origin that reflect the company\'s vision for the future of natural resource exploration. NEO means \'new\' or the re-interpretation of something that already exists. EOS is the goddess of the dawn, light, and illumination. We intend for NEOS to convey the dawn of a new era of exploration in which multiple geoscience datasets are interpreted in new ways to better illuminate the subsurface.""\n\nThe company\'s rebranding will be supported through an integrated promotional campaign that includes print, on-line, and multimedia initiatives as well as the launch of a new company website at: www.neosgeo.com .\n\nAbout NEOS GeoSolutions\n\nNEOS helps exploration teams in the onshore oil & gas and mining industries make faster, more informed decisions about where to explore, lease and drill. In partnership with its clients, NEOS acquires and simultaneously interprets multiple geological, geophysical, and geochemical datasets to identify hydrocarbons and minerals in the subsurface. The company is backed by a group of internationally recognized investors, including Goldman Sachs, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and Passport Capital.

The company will operate under the new brand Mobiuz, Trend reports citing the Uzbek media.\n\n""UMS rebranding is a necessary and expected step in the transformation of the company, since UMS has received radically new directions and incentives to expand its activities. The mobile operator is tasked to gradually ensure the most complete coverage of the territory of Uzbekistan, by connecting to the global Internet at the level of developed countries, ensuring the provision of all public services exclusively through the operator\'s data processing centers,"" the company said.\n\nAlso, along with its current activities, the company has become the operator of public services, introducing government mobile communications and cryptographically protected first national messenger UzChat.\n\nIn addition, a unified national information system for project management, blockchain solutions for the public sector, and digitized public services for the population are being created on the UMS platform. All this will allow to develop an e-government system, introduce information systems in public administration, and implement a unified state policy in this area.\n\n""In such circumstances, the rebranding of the company should meet new trends, carry values, semantic and ideological component and at the same time be easy to understand. With this in mind, it was decided to change the brand of the mobile operator to Mobiuz,"" the company said.\n\nRebranding work began in December 2018 with the development of the name, color identification and other parameters of the brand. Further rebranding will be carried out in stages. These steps will allow to \'refresh\' the company\'s brand and give signals to the public about the new positioning. The new brand will also serve to effectively identify the market and create a new image.\n\nIn late November 2018, UMS was transferred to the Digital Economy Development Support Fund ""Digital Trust"", which in turn is controlled by the National Agency for Project Management.\n\nPreviously, UMS was granted the right of direct access to international telecommunications networks (data and voice networks), including the use of IP telephony technology only for its own commercial needs, without the right to provide services to other operators and providers for the organization of international voice telephony channels and Internet traffic.\n\n---\n\nFollow the author on Twitter: @ShirinovRashid\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); TRENDS (90%); DIGITAL ECONOMY (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); NEW ECONOMY (78%); ELECTRONIC GOVERNMENT (75%); BLOCKCHAIN (69%); CRYPTOLOGY (69%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (91%); BRANDING (90%); COMPUTING & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (90%); INFORMATION MANAGEMENT (89%); DIGITAL ECONOMY (78%); FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (78%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (78%); TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT (78%); INTERNET & WWW (75%); INTERNET TELEPHONY (75%); CORPORATE POSITIONING (73%); DATA PROCESSING SERVICES (73%); BLOCKCHAIN (69%); CRYPTOLOGY (69%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0BAKU, AZERBAIJAN (79%); UZBEKISTAN (94%); ASIA (92%); CENTRAL ASIA (91%); AZERBAIJAN (79%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 3, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Uzbek mobile operator implementing rebranding,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=e4fe77bd-e037-4a41-b703-67175a4cc4ec&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5V3Y-3821-JBMJ-30X2-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=432763&pdteaserkey=sr185&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr185&prid=ed2943ba-7b6a-49c3-8b82-3367a37337bc,2019-01-04,1.0

However, history doesn't provide enough evidence on the evolution of handloom and batik though these industries have contributed to the GDP of the country. Handloom and Batik later had to have a focus on the tourism industry as the Sri Lankan government removed 100% levies on imports of fabric and finished garments as they believed in comparative advantage which was recommended by economic experts who advocated globalisation.\n\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic hitting the world in an unprecedented level, as economies are shrinking and as imports have become a burden on the balance of payment due to increase in exchange rates, the time has come for us to re-visit our strategies.\n\nIn this backdrop, there are two industries which were dying a natural death that have found their way back to the market. Following the direction set by His Excellency the President, Gotabhaya Rajapakse, a separate ministry is now established to revamp batik a handloom under a positive and pleasant personality who truly believes in upbringing and rejuvenating local industries.\n\nAs passionate and energetic as he is about the sector, he seems to be backed by true professionals in setting up objectives, strategies and KPIs to achieve a national goal with regards to the industries under his purview.\n\nAs Marketers, it's interesting to look at as to how a marketer can play a role from the perspective of brand building; building a strong brand for Sri Lanka Handloom and Batik.\n\n1. Identification of pain points - Any brand needs to address the pain points that the customer or consumer encounters with the brand. As far as batik and handloom are concerned, the pain points are; less color fastening (Fading or reducing of colors), not easy to drape, wash and iron and also not having places to buy. On top of these utilitarian pain points one of the main issues that prevail in the industry today is lack of new designs and vibrancy in colors. Addition to the product based pain-points there could be another pain point which is directly connected with the price. As the intermediaries retain a fat layer for themselves the manufacturers have lost the opportunity of making sufficient income and consumers keep paying an exorbitant price. This itself has become the bottle neck which prevents industry growth, as Batik and handloom have become more of a niche product which is limited to the spending cluster of the market.\n\n2. Identification of hot-buttons - Whilst the whole world is being paranoid about COVID-19 pandemic, Sri Lanka is enjoying the benefits of being disciplined right from the point where the pandemic began. As a result, it's predicted that Sri Lanka will have many opportunities in the tourism sector in time to come. Not only that, there seems to be an inclination of the local consumer towards purchasing and consuming locally made products. On the other hand, the government is keen to save her reserves which are spent on imports as Sri Lanka imports close upon 5mn sarees in a year from various countries. Not only that but also Sri Lanka has become a dumping yard for cheap finished apparels which are flooded through various formal and informal sources. These conditions have made a conducive environment for Sri Lanka to get into local apparel, batik and handloom.\n\nWhat are the gaps identified\n\nin these industries?\n\nThere are six main gaps pertaining to the sectors which are categorically identified by the minister and his team.\n\ni. Design and Development - As the industry was dying a natural death over the years, there has never been an organised well thought process in promoting new designing to the sector. The designs which are used by the majority of manufacturers are staled designs which were used decades back when these industries were booming in Sri Lanka.\n\nii.Market Demand - If the sectors are to grow and prosper, there has to be a continuous demand created to support the production. As of now the industry is more or less waiting for orders but this is not going to be viable if the industry is to be developed.\n\niii.Raw Material - There is no proper supply of quality material in the market and also the prices of material are sky-high due to low volumes that prevail in the market. The challenge is to provide a consistent quality material flow which can be purchased by the manufacturers at an affordable price. Intermediaries trying to make profits with raw material is not a positive sign for any industry as it will prevent new players entering the industry as there is no motive for a new comer to enter the market where there is no room for profit making.\n\niv.Productivity and Technology - Productivity of handloom is at a bare minimum level due to usage of handloom machines which have traditionally being used by domestic manufactures. Also the machines which are under-utilised or un-utilised are not supporting the industry to reach its true potential. This has also impacted the income generation potential of the industry as the number of units a machine can make depends purely on the number of labour hours. Introduction of machine-loom will be a possible solution for these issues.\n\nv. Skills and Human Resource - Skilled labour and human resources are two key elements which can decide the success of this industry. The sector is in danger as the younger generation is reluctant to be a part of this industry due to low wages and earning potential. As mentioned above technology will have to play a key role in this aspect and training to up-skill labour is something of paramount importance at this point of time. The training schools which are governed by the Provincial Councils are not adding any value to the process as they are non-operational or semi-operational due to various issues such as lack of funds allocated to Provincial councils particularly for this purpose. Lack of ownership and lack of focus have also been issues in the sector.\n\nvi.Sustainability - In addition to the sustainability of the industry itself, environmental sustainability is also a concern at this point as these industries can contribute towards water and soil pollution. This aspect of the operation will require a considerable investment but it will pay the price when it comes to the point of sustaining the industry in the long run.\n\nAs a true brand marketer after considering the MACRO and MICRO issues pertaining to the industry, the next step would be to set objectives and strategies. It's evident that this industry needs an overall instant boost to kickoff operations. There will have to be investments in the fields of technology, R and D, Designs, training, market development, channel development etc. Assuming that the hurdles are overcome, what would be the thinking that can drive a branded market for this industry is the question in hand\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nBranding challenge and Strategy\n\nThe real challenge for the industry as mentioned above is to create a sustainable demand. There can be various approaches that the ministry can take in addressing this aspect of the strategy.\n\ni. Positioning the Saree as a beauty enhancer of Sri Lankan ladies - Changing consumer habits is a challenge to overcome with consumer insights. As far as this national task is concerned, it will also be about creating a national movement with a valid reason to buy local products provided they bring novel designs to meet the expectations of the market. As a matter of fact Sri Lankan ladies look elegant in sarees than any other dress. From corporate leaders, to teachers, to bankers many professionals such as lawyers and doctors still wear sarees as they know it enhances; credibility, respect and true femininity when they are in sarees. If the saree could be made affordable for masses and if it's widely being made available for ladies to buy, there will be a boom in the industry. Setting trends and creating value are the two things a true brand marketer is capable of and there will be many who can shoulder this task in the industry of advertising and marketing. Support of media (Both traditional and digital) will be required if this is to be implemented.\n\nii.National events - Sri Lanka should celebrate her national independence day with locally made flags marking the beginning of her journey towards economic independence. Ladies can wear a saree on Independence Day and gents can wear sarong and shirt which could be in the form of Batik or Handloom. Christians and Catholics can wear batik or handloom for Christmas when they go for mid night mass. This can continue till March / April 2021 where we celebrate Sinhalese and Tamil New Year. This movement has the opportunity to unite Sri Lanka under one flag and needless to say we can make batik outfits for Muslim brothers and sisters for their festival days too.\n\niii.Product and category extensions - Without limiting the potential to everyday wear, the range can be extended to industry specific products such as bed-linen, pillow covers, cushion covers and wall hangings which are currently imported to Sri Lanka by spending dollars.\n\niv.Creating an Export Brand for overseas markets - through a nationally coordinated effort, the ministry can also conquer overseas markets where there are Sri Lankans who are awaiting quality local handloom and Batik products. Sri Lankans residing in various parts of the world can join hands with the ministry and it can generate much needed foreign income too.\n\nv. Creating a retail chain - Despite the quality and design aspects of the strategy, it also needs to look at the distribution aspect and price. Price has to be affordable for masses with an option given for exclusivity for those who need an extra quality product at a higher price. Both online and offline distribution is a prerequisite if this strategy is to work. Rebranding and revamping Laksala and Salusala and Schools of handloom will also be required along with online channels embedded in them.\n\nvi.Establishing production facilities and training facilities - Any brand is as good as the quality of the offer or the product. A Brand created without a quality product won't last long as consumers won't come back to buy the brand. Hence, it's important that quality standards are specified and maintained across the industry even if it's made in small scale industries or domestically. Clean, neat production facilities, appropriate working conditions, attention to sustainability and ample facilities spread around the country will be primarily required for this industry to flourish.\n\nvii.Attracting new players to the industry - this should be one of the key aspects of the strategy in meeting the demand which can possibly be created through a national level campaign for batik and handloom. As the industry has burnt the fingers of entrepreneurs and investors in the past due to poor decisions made by certain regimes, creating confidence in the minds of potential investors and industrialists is also an important element in boosting the sector. There should be a national level policy which would say that the macro factors such as government levies on imports will not be removed at least for ten years if the confidence is to be built in the hearts of the business community and manufacturers.\n\nThere is an opportunity before the country to drive the local economy through an innovative strategy which can pass its benefits to the needy segments in the country.\n\nIt will also add a new chapter in positioning Sri Lanka as a tourist destination. However, it will all be possible only if the government supports this industry and if a national level momentum can be created to buy the products.\n\nWe can be proud of us on the day we send the first container out of Sri Lanka which is full of handloom and batik products to another destination where there is a demand for these exclusive clothing. But the path is still opening for many stakeholders.\n\nIf each stakeholder group works only for their benefit, the ultimate goal will move away from us as a country. If we can rise together and create a proposition and a strong national brand for Batik and Handloom, not only will it generate revenues, it will also be a part of branding the nation for tourism which will most probably flourish when the pandemic is over.\n\nIf we can create 100 villages for batik and handloom within the next year and if we can support it with industrial input, we will get closer to the target of building a prosperous nation by making productive citizens and happy families which will be a corner stone of a disciplined and a prosperous nation.\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",Revamping/ rebranding Batik and Handloom in Sri Lanka,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=d06dafb0-5a0d-48d8-b9dd-08c4ca901d2f&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60WM-5PS1-F00C-60H7-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=416463&pdteaserkey=sr10&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr10&prid=c863d4a6-08b5-4ce0-a8b5-feef716cd3c1,2020-09-20,0.0

They found that consumers who are strongly committed to a brand tend to react more negatively toward new logos, while more casual customers typically view the redesigns as a positive development. Further, this negativity felt toward the new logo by the brand\'s best customers can spill over and cause them to have a lower attitude toward the brand.\n\nStrong brands such as Starbucks gain much of their strength from consumers who feel a personal connection to the brand. However, it\'s these same passionate brand fans who react negatively to logo changes, and, in the case of Starbucks, took to social networking websites to express their negative feelings about the change.\n\n""Most companies presume that their most precious customers -- those having strong brand commitment -- will be more accommodating to changes,"" the researchers write. ""Our results show this is likely a mistaken assumption -- one that can alienate the core, the most committed of a brands customers.""\n\nTo test their hypothesis, Winterich and her colleagues examined how 632 undergraduate students responded to logo redesigns for Adidas and New Balance athletic shoes. They had a professional graphic designer create two new versions of each brand\'s logo, one slightly modified from the original and the second one considerably more so. Each participant was surveyed about their brand commitment and attitude after viewing the original logo and then again after viewing one of the redesigns.\n\nThey found that brand attitudes decreased for those strongly committed to the brand and increased for the weakly committed. The authors believe that committed brand enthusiasts view the logo changes as threatening to their relationship with the brand.\n\n""Those with strong brand commitment will see the original brand logo -- and the associations -- as representing themselves and the integral relationship they have with the brand,"" the researchers write. ""They are likely to view a change in the logo, which affects these associations, as threatening their self-brand connections and relationships. Consequently, such consumers will be negatively disposed to the logo change and likely to evaluate the logo negatively.""\n\nWinterich and her coauthors suggest that companies take a nuanced approach to logo redesign. They recommend soliciting input about the redesign from the brand\'s most committed consumers and perhaps even notifying them before the changes are revealed to the broader public. ""Giving the strongly committed such a feeling of being an \'insider\' may strengthen their self-brand connection and mitigate the potentially negative effects of logo redesign,"" they write.\n\nTheir study, ""Do Logo Redesigns Help or Hurt Your Brand? The Role of Brand Commitment,"" was published in 2010 in the Journal of Product and Brand Management.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newswire\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0CONSUMERS (90%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); BRAND EQUITY (90%); BRANDING (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); WRITERS (89%); BUSINESS EDUCATION (78%); COLLEGE STUDENTS (78%); SOCIAL NETWORKING (77%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (73%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (52%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 STARBUCKS CORP (93%);  NEW BALANCE ATHLETIC SHOE INC (53%)\n\n\n\nOrganization:\xc2\xa0PENN STATE UNIVERSITY (91%); RICE UNIVERSITY (57%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0SBUX (NASDAQ) (93%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); BRAND EQUITY (90%); BRANDING (90%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); WRITERS (89%); GRAPHIC DESIGN SERVICES (78%); COLLEGE STUDENTS (78%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (52%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0PENNSYLVANIA, USA (88%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 10, 2011\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",THE STARBUCKS EFFECT_ COMMITTED CUSTOMERS DON'T LIKE LOGO REDESIGNS.docx,,,0.0

Sometimes a company's top brass realizes market shifts, once deemed temporary, are here to stay. At other times, those same leaders might decide that even though the market is steady, the company itself would gain reaching toward a new and different type of customer.So. Much. \n\nTech.Some of the biggest names in tech are coming to TNW Conference in Amsterdam this May.Whatever the reason, rebranding is always a gamble. The average company will rebrand itself every seven to 10 years, but before doing so, smart companies know to ask themselves a series of important questions to make sure they emerge from their relaunch a stronger, sleeker and better-connected version of themselves. Here are seven questions every smart company should ask itself before taking the relaunch plunge:1) Why are we rebranding?Rebranding means shaking up your identity, sacrificing your hard-earned familiarity with customers and wading into the waters of a new and untested market. It can provide stellar strategic gains, but only if handled with care. Clicktale, where I serve as Chief Marketing Officer, is currently going through its own rebranding. Our reasons? After 10 years as a start-up enabling companies to improve the digital customer experience, the market has shifted, and so have we. Whereas we once primarily targeted small businesses to help them strengthen and cultivate their online customer experiences, now we're the go-to digital customer experience management platform for enterprise. And along the way, we've learned to take the same advice we offer our customers: when overhauling a website or an entire brand, the trick is to focus not just on fashion but also on function. You have to do more than just look good and adopt the new style\xc2\xa0-\xc2\xa0you also have to make sure that underneath the hood (or the homepage) your company is running flawlessly, and is focusing exactly where it needs to be. So what do you hope to accomplish and why do you feel it's necessary? Has the market shifted to such a degree that your profit lines are slipping? Has your customer base moved and you feel the need to catch up? The bottom line: There are many great reasons for taking the rebranding plunge, but make sure that you and your entire staff agree that the need is great enough to justify the risk.2) Is the board on board?When your company is rebranding, think of it like an army marching into battle, or a chorus line dancing across the stage. Every leg needs to be in sync; every boot needs to hit the ground at the same time. For rebranding, a unified front is key. What you are doing when you rebrand is actually shifting the DNA of your company from the inside. That means that everyone - from the CEO to the marketing manager to the head of client services - needs to be in agreement as to how that DNA is going to look and feel. The bottom line: You're all part of the same team, and this is the biggest game you've ever played. Make sure you're doing it as one.3) Should we change the logo?If you think a company rebrand means an automatic reboot of your logo, think again. In fact, think 10 times about it, sleep on it, and then give it one more think just to be sure. If rebranding is a snazzy new haircut, a reboot of the company's logo is plastic surgery of one's entire face and body. You want to look new, fresh and exciting to your customers, but you also want to make sure they still recognize you when you walk down the street. A company rebrand means you take the best elements of what your enterprise was, hone in on the pieces of your business that may not be working for you anymore, and do surgical, precise overhauls to push yourself into future markets. A logo is your identity, your beating heart, and the calling card with which you go out into the world. There is absolutely a time and a place for a fresh logo, but companies who make that call understand that it's a decision separate from the decision to rebrand. The bottom line: Make sure that after you rebrand, the customers who know and love you can still recognize you. And if that means keeping your logo intact, do it.4) Where do you see yourself in three years?Ah, the cheesy, oft-repeated interview question. How many young interns have walked into your office, a borrowed tie around their neck and briefcase in hand, to be faced with that question? There's a reason hiring managers love to ask potential employees where they see themselves going: it's a question that can speak volumes about their potential to grow and change with the company. So if you're considering a rebrand, put your own company in the hot seat, and grill it just as you would an eager hire. If you've decided to rebrand, it's because your company isn't getting where it needs to be. So ask yourself: Where do we want to go? Pinpoint that answer, and then start dreaming, acting, and doing business like you are already there. Bonus points: When thinking about where you want to be in three years, make sure you also identify who your customer base is going to be when you get there, and start playing to them now. The bottom line: Just as you should dress for the job you want and not the job you have, rebranding means acting like the company you want to be, not the one you currently are.5) So you know who you want to be as a company. But who do you NOT want to be?For questions of identity, there's always a flip side that deserves equal scrutiny. Don't be so busy outlining how you want your company to look that you forget to take time to pinpoint the traits you want to be sure to avoid. While you're envisioning exactly how you are going to look in three years, you have to also decide what you are going to give up in order get there. Get your board together - that unified, army-like board of directors we discussed in step two\xc2\xa0- and come to a consensus together of how you are going to define yourself, and what moves could derail you on the way. Make sure everyone agrees on the potential pitfalls that could make you stumble, and that each and every leader of your company knows how to avoid them. The bottom line: Clarify your priorities, and in doing so, make it clear what you're willing to give up in order to get them.6) How are you going to celebrate?A relaunch is a lot of work, sure, but it's also a time for major celebration. Your company is evolving. It's taking active and deliberate steps to secure a better future for your brand, and for all the hard workers who show up each day to push it further. This is a critical time for your employees, and it's important that you celebrate it as a success. Celebrate your rebranding, and invite staffers across the board and from all levels of management to do the same. How you choose to celebrate is up to you, but whether you pop champagne at the next company meeting, send out a series of inspirational emails from the C-suite or throw a dedicated party worthy of a wedding planner, make sure you focus on the progress you are feeling now and the even bigger things to come. The bottom line: If you want your rebranding to be a success, celebrate it as the first step of something spectacular. And make sure every employee is in the loop and able to get in on the fun.7) Did you pack your foundation?No matter where you're going, it's important to never lose sight of where you came from. This lesson, which is vital in all sorts of life situations, applies especially well to company rebrandings. Your business is going to new and exciting places only because it started off somewhere great. So before you can remake yourself, make sure you understand what you're starting with. Who are you as a company? What values, cultures and mottos sit at your core and deserve to travel with you through the relaunch? There's no one who can answer those questions better than your customers, so make sure you include them in the move. Talk to your best clients. Ask them what they value about their relationship with you, and what qualities they cherish most. Then stay true to those ever-crucial traits that made you who are you are in the first place. The bottom line: You want to evolve, but you don't want to erase yourself completely. Make sure you know what's at the core of your company culture, and that you stick to it no matter how much you grow.

Alida is the creator of the world\'s first comprehensive Customer Experience Management (CXM) and insights platform. The company\'s new brand name and visual identity showcases its ongoing dedication to helping brands create meaningful customer relationships.\n\nAlida\'s history is steeped in helping iconic brands like Buzzfeed, LinkedIn and Red Bull change their business for the better by uncovering customer motivations, opinions, and sentiment through an award-winning customer insights platform. Now, the newly refocused brand will build upon this expertise and help global brands act on these uncovered customer \'truths\' to deliver world-class customer experiences.\n\nAggressive Growth Path in CXM\n\nAlida has been on an aggressive growth path, beginning in early 2020 with a new executive leadership team, including SAP veteran Ross Wainwright as CEO. Since then, the company released a number of new customer-led innovations to advance toward its transformation into a value-based CXM leader. With deep subject matter expertise and specialized tools for major industries such as Retail, CPG, Media, Technology, Financial Services, and Healthcare, this rebrand is just the latest move by Alida to disrupt the over-saturated CXM market.\n\n""The CXM space today is crowded with vendors that offer transactional functions that don\'t lead to real business value,"" said Wainwright. ""It\'s not just about driving products and services, it\'s about creating an actionable experience for customers, employees, and partners that drives loyalty. Our new brand stays true to our company values while personifying where we believe the future to be.""\n\n""With a recent $US20 million investment from Vistara Capital Partners we expedited our ambitious growth strategy and are poised to achieve our mission of helping businesses make decisions with their customers, not for them,"" continued Wainwright.\n\nAlida: Truth In Action\n\nAlida has Latin origins and means verity, truth, reality and actuality, which is the ultimate goal for brands tapping into the real source of truth: their customers. A tribute to the essence of the heroine, unexpected in the often linear, predictable and hard-edge world of technology, the name evokes a sense of strength, humanity and empathy.\n\nMajor customers agree that the new brand is a game-changing move. ""This rebrand is exceptional work,"" said Cedric Painvin, Associate Vice President of Consumer Research at Canadian Tire. ""You have struck a perfect balance that recognizes the diversity of leaders in the CX space which will surely propel you into a very exciting next phase.""\n\n""As a 6-year-strong enterprise customer, I am thrilled to introduce Alida to our wider team within The Stars Group and Flutter Businesses,"" said Ben Fox, Department Head of Group Research, Consumer Market & Understanding at The Stars Group.\n\nThe Alida product portfolio will now follow a functional naming strategy. Alida Touchpoint, Alida Surveys, and Alida Sparq empower customer-obsessed brands to collect and action both broad feedback and deep insights to ensure that every decision is designed to elevate customer experience.\n\nAbout Alida\n\nAlida believes in a world where customers are the ultimate source of truth. A world where the best business decisions are those made with customers, not for them. That\'s why Alida created the world\'s first CXM and insights platform to turn customer truth into action.

This is in response to ever-increasing market demand for performance and sustainability.\n\n\n\n Products under the Envirocore Series include OneCem Portland Limestone Cement, MaxCem Blended Cement, and NewCem Slag Cement.\n\n\n\n As the largest cement manufacturer in the U.S., LafargeHolcim is calling on architects, engineers, contractors and ready-mix producers to adopt more sustainable products in order to lower the industry's carbon footprint.\n\n\n\n In the US, Holcim plants have produced more than 3 million metric tons of OneCem for concrete construction applications throughout the country.\n\n\n\n The company said concrete has a high carbon footprint due to the energy intensiveness and generation of CO2 in Portland cement manufacturing.

Datacard was founded in 1969 by Willis Drake, an early employee of pioneering computer-technology companies in Minnesota and a founder of Control Data Corp.\n\nDatacard Corp. got its start by helping financial and retail companies quickly produce credit cards for customers.\n\nIt added security products such as employee identification, passports and other secure personalized identification.\n\nDatacard was publicly traded for a period before it was acquired in 1987 by the family investment office of Germany\'s Quandt family, which also owns a big stake in German automaker BMW.\n\nThe family investment office has been a patient long-term owner and investor in Datacard. Management has not had to worry about the quarter to quarter financial pressure that public companies deal with or a revolving door of private-equity owners.\n\n""It gives us the latitude to invest long-term, make investments to grow the business, and then see them all the way through,"" said Todd Wilkinson, who has been president and chief executive of the company since 2008. ""A lot of the transformation in the company over the last 10 years-plus has really come in large part because of that shareholder model.""\n\nAt that time Datacard, which largely relied on physical assets like card printing and issuance machines, began to develop more software and digital products through research and development and acquisitions.\n\nDatacard in 2013 acquired Entrust, a provider of digital data security services tied to identity protection. In 2014, the company changed its name to Entrust Datacard.\n\nAs Entrust Datacard, company officials believed people either recognized one name or the other not that the two businesses were closely intertwined.\n\nThe idea for a rebrand had been brewing for awhile as the company drove further along the digital security path. But the hard work toward a brand relaunch started 18 months ago.\n\n""We are a brand that consumers generally don\'t know, but we are in their life whether they know it or not,"" said Karen Kaukol, chief marketing officer, who led the rebranding effort. ""How do we start to marry that technology story with that very real human impact we have on day-to-day life? That\'s what we set out to do with the rebrand.""\n\nThe team sought professional advice on a new name but were told they already had one they should keep.\n\n""Entrust is your brand promise in a word,"" branding experts told Kaukol, she said. ""Make it bigger, make it better, make it mean more.""\n\nThe rebrand launch hit a roadblock with the coronavirus pandemic. It was originally scheduled to launch in April.\n\nUltimately, the rebrand was about clear communication of the company\'s products and services, which only grew in importance during the pandemic.\n\nThe pandemic accelerated digital-transformation trends from telecommuting to e-commerce, stressing corporate IT security teams. Entrust\'s suite of products helps solve security problems from a remote work team or computer purchases.\n\nDuring the rebranding delay, some marketing plans were canceled. For example, the company originally planned to have some airport advertising for traveling IT executives and some in-person events for employees, customers and partners had to be moved to virtual formats.\n\n""I\'m really proud of our team in reimagining what a launch could look like,"" Kaukol said. ""We just had to recalibrate some of the more celebratory aspects of the launch.""\n\nEntrust is a global company, but its largest location is its Minnesota headquarters where 850 of its more than 2,500 employees work. It has about $800 million in annual revenue.\n\nThe company hopes the brand relaunch lets people know Entrust\'s full portfolio of services.\n\n""It is really about us explaining our unique role in delivering trust to our clients in terms of protecting identity, payments and data,"" Kaukol said.\n\nThe messaging is aimed at CEOs and chief information officers who are investing big dollars in their companies\' digital transformations. But it also is a signal to its own employees about Entrust\'s focus going forward.\n\n""We help people to move securely, we help your data move securely, we help payments move securely, we help you personally as you cross borders and travel to move securely,"" Wilkinson said.\n\nHe added the company plans to be ""an even more significant, an even more sizable growth technology company here in the Twin Cities.""\n\n""You are going to hear more from us,"" he said.\n\nPatrick Kennedy \xc2\xb7 612-673-7926\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newspaper\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); REBRANDING (90%); SOCIOLOGY (90%); EXECUTIVES (87%); COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT (78%); COMPANY NAME CHANGES (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); SHAREHOLDERS (78%); CONSUMERS (77%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (77%); PRIVATE EQUITY (68%); SAFETY (%); TECHNOLOGY (%); PROFILE (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 DATACARD GROUP (85%);  ARBITRON INC (83%);  CERIDIAN CORP (71%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS333318 OTHER COMMERCIAL & SERVICE INDUSTRY MACHINERY MANUFACTURING (85%); NAICS326199 ALL OTHER PLASTICS PRODUCT MANUFACTURING (85%); SIC3579 OTHER OFFICE MACHINES (85%); SIC3089 PLASTICS PRODUCTS, NEC (85%); NAICS518210 DATA PROCESSING, HOSTING & RELATED SERVICES (83%); SIC8732 COMMERCIAL ECONOMIC, SOCIOLOGICAL, & EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH (83%); SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, & BOOKKEEPING SERVICES (83%); SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING & DATA PREPARATION & PROCESSING SERVICES (83%); NAICS522320 FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING, RESERVE & CLEARINGHOUSE ACTIVITIES (71%); BRANDING (90%); MACHINERY & EQUIPMENT MFG (90%); MANUFACTURING (90%); MISC PLASTIC PRODUCTS MFG (90%); PLASTICS (90%); REBRANDING (90%); DATA SECURITY (89%); INFORMATION SECURITY & PRIVACY (89%); MARKET RESEARCH FIRMS (89%); ADVERTISING SLOGANS (78%); BOOKKEEPING & PAYROLL SERVICES (78%); CREDIT CARDS (78%); IDENTITY SECURITY (78%); RETAIL & WHOLESALE TRADE (78%); AUTOMOBILE MFG (77%); AUTOMOTIVE MFG (77%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (77%); ONLINE SECURITY & PRIVACY (77%); ACCOUNTING (76%); COMPUTER SOFTWARE (71%); RETAILERS (69%); PRIVATE EQUITY (68%); AUTOMAKERS (67%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0MINNESOTA, USA (90%); GERMANY (90%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 15, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Rebranding of Entrust highlights security ,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=878353be-9662-49e0-9514-5e3f5eb00898&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60VF-KYR1-DYRH-90N7-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8384&pdteaserkey=sr16&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr16&prid=c863d4a6-08b5-4ce0-a8b5-feef716cd3c1,2020-09-15,1.0

All opinions are our own. 10. Bacard\xc3\xad\n\n\n\n The world-famous rum brand Bacard\xc3\xad[2] decided to embrace its roots this year with a new logo that harks back to a design from the 1930s and an ad campaign dramatizing Cuban history. While we find the new direction interesting, the bat icon could use some polish to pop \xe2\x80\x94 and we're not crazy about the font, especially the slanted tilde used as an accent mark.\n\n\n\n9. Cole Haan\n\n\n\n Cole Haan[3] is best known for its men's footwear but is cementing its image as a fashion brand with a variety of clothing, shoes, and accessories for both men and women. Part of this strategy involves the transition to a new logo and monogram[4], which we find sharp on their own, but we think Cole Haan has dialed back some of its artsy charm to fit in more with the likes of Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein.\n\n\n\n8. Olive Garden\n\n\n\n Olive Garden had a rough year. It announced a major redesign meant to appeal to a younger, hipper crowd in March, but a critical presentation in September from activist hedge fund Starboard[5]\xc2\xa0got much more media attention. The new logo looks flat, and the faux handwritten font is unappealing. It does not seem likely to attract the new customer base the company is after.\n\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider[6]\n\n [1]: http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/ [2]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.bacardi.com [3]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.colehaan.com/ [4]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/cole_haan_monogram_pattern.png [5]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.businessinsider.com/darden-olive-garden-presentation-2014-9?utm_source=partnerutm_medium=newstexutm_term=originalutm_campaign=partner [6]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.businessinsider.com/worst-corporate-logo-changes-2014-12?utm_source=partnerutm_medium=newstexutm_term=originalutm_campaign=partner#7-ymca-england-4 \n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0English\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Blog\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa0BZIN-5352\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (92%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 COLE-HAAN (84%)\n\n\n\nOrganization:\xc2\xa0Calvin Klein\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS316210 FOOTWEAR MANUFACTURING (84%); SIC3149 FOOTWEAR, EXCEPT RUBBER, NEC (84%); REBRANDING (92%); FASHION DESIGNERS (90%); FOOTWEAR (90%); MANUFACTURING (90%); CLOTHING LABELS (78%); FASHION ACCESSORIES (78%); FOOTWEAR MFG (77%); ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE INDUSTRY (73%); DISTILLED LIQUORS (71%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (70%); MARKETING CAMPAIGNS (70%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0RALPH LAUREN (58%); Cole Haan; Ralph Lauren\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0December 22, 2014\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",The 10 Worst Corporate Logo Changes Of 2014.docx,,,1.0

The new platform is designed to help marketers stop ad fraud, make decisions confidently, create new performance partnerships, and grow their business globally. \xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 (Logo:https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/656461/Impact_Logo.jpg)\n\nAs part of the rebrand, the company has integrated its three solutions: Forensiq (acquired in 2016), Altitude (formerly ClearSaleing and Media Manager, acquired in 2015), and Radius (formerly Impact Radius and Partner Manager) into one natively integrated marketing platform of essential marketing technologies for fraud detection and prevention; media measurement, attribution, and mix optimization; management, payment, optimization, and growth of traditional performance marketing, and strategic business partnerships. Solution overviews are:\n\nForensiq:Powered by machine learning, Forensiq offers a sophisticated, multi-channel fraud detection solution with a particular focus on advanced mobile fraud detection techniques, including device hijacking detection and user behavior clustering analysis to ensure marketers are protected in the fast-growing mobile channel. Given Forensiq\'s heritage working with the supply side in rooting out fraud at the source, it has the capacity to detect more fraud for both the demand and supply sides. As the digital armor protecting marketing and ad spend, Forensiq detects and protects against fraud in pre-bid and post-buy, and at all points in the marketing funnel from impression to conversion, offering a unique fraud-first approach to verification.\n\nAltitude: Altitude is a marketer\'s trusted system of record for tracking, ingesting, cleansing, normalizing, and enhancing all cross-channel marketing data. Everything from marketing KPIs, including lifetime value (LTV) and acquisition performance metrics, to deep insights are consistently measured and effortlessly derived from a trustworthy, cross-device view of the customer journey. Altitude leverages sophisticated machine learning algorithmic attribution and media mix modelling to move beyond last click measurement and help marketers make informed and confident decisions on how to best allocate their marketing spend and effectively drive growth. \xc2\xa0\n\nRadius: Marketers rely on Radius to create new and direct performance partnerships, including traditional affiliates, influencers, and strategic business development partnerships. Radius simplifies the discovery, contracting, tracking, reporting, and payment processing, so partnership managers can focus on optimizing each relationship for growth and ROI. With cross-channel and cross-device journey reporting, Radius shows partners\' performance in context. And with new Dynamic Payouts functionality, it\'s easy to pay each partner based on the specific value they drive, whether that value comes early or late in the conversion path.\n\nAs marketing technology continues to evolve, tech stacks grow more complex, and data becomes more complicated to analyze and interpret, Impact\'s new marketing technology platform aims to simplify things by offering precise and actionable intelligence so marketers, brands, and agencies can maximize growth, and ultimately regain confidence in marketing spend.\n\n""Impact\'s new marketing technology platform is designed to help marketers execute and improve their paid marketing and media strategies through more simplified, scalable, efficient, and effective technology,"" said David A. Yovanno, CEO, Impact.\n\n""Answering brands\' demands for simplification, transparency, performance, and trust across their paid marketing and media spend, Impact is proud to be first-to-market with a natively integrated core marketing suite of this kind. For example, we are the first to be able to identify and cleanse fraud before measurement, and to apply marketing intelligence and algorithmic attribution to inform optimal investments in advertising and commission payments to performance partnerships,"" Yovanno added. ""Impact is committed to building disruptive, customer-driven technologies that make marketing easier and more effective, while giving brands the confidence they need to scale their business growth through marketing.""\n\n""We\'re excited about Impact\'s new integrated marketing platform and are currently using Radius to grow our global performance partnerships. We firmly believe in the company\'s vision and integrated solutions strategy and think it will help brands achieve more transparency and trust in their marketing spend. We\'re also very optimistic that Altitude can improve our marketing ROI and are in the process of evaluating it as key component of our marketing ecosystem,"" said Carlo Savino, Executive Director, N.A. eCommerce, Lenovo.\n\nAbout Impact:\xc2\xa0\n\nImpact is a marketing technology company helping brands grow by optimizing their paid marketing and media spend.

That\'s based on a recently reported[1] teardown of the Google Home application. Within the code, as of app version 2.28, there are several instances where ""Google TV"" is referenced. \n\nSpecifically in descriptors. The strings still also reverence Android TV, calling it ""atv,"" suggesting this change isn\'t quite ready for primetime. Or, at the very least, that Googlers haven\'t made the effort yet to change the referencing in the code. That\'s something that could happen at any time in the development process. Or it could change the branding with the launch of a new product.Why is this code change appearing in the Google Home app?Now, it might be expected that changes to Android TV, particularly branding[2], would appear first in associated apps. Or in code pertaining to the platform itself. That\'s as opposed to in the Google Home app. But the code itself also centers around another device. Namely, the Android TV dongle codenamed Google Sabrina. That dongle is expected[3] to act as a kind of update to the Google Chromecast devices that are currently on the market. But, instead of just working to receive Chromecast signals, it also functions as a full-blown Android TV device. Leaks have pinned down a price for Sabrina around $50 or $60. And the package comes complete with a bundled remote control for the device. There has already been a plethora of other information about Sabrina in leaks, leading up to the eventual launch. But it may be that launch that explains why Android TV rebranding is happening in Google Home. Google Home is a central hub for controlling smart home devices. That includes smart home devices such as the upcoming TV dongle from Google. If the company plans to announce Google TV branding at the same time, it makes sense for the code changes to be associated with the Google Home app.When will Sabrina and, potentially, Google TV arrive?As of this writing, Google is expected to kick off an upcoming event a bit early for 2020. As early as September 30, compared to earlier events in early- or mid-October. That\'s the search giant\'s annual hardware event and, as a result, the above-mentioned Sabrina TV dongle is expected to arrive at that event. Because the two products appear to be related, the event would appear to be a reasonable platform for both Android TV-related[4] announcements.

Randall Keene, chairman and chief executive officer of Stratus. ""Since then, we have grown to offer a variety of other neurology-focused services that were each represented under a different brand name. For simplification, now all of our company brands will be known as Stratus.""\n\n\n\n""We are proud to be the market leader who has served more than 53,000 patients and thousands of physicians across the United States. While Stratus is a new name for our company, we will continue our focus and dedication on being the trusted leader in neurodiagnostic services known for quality, exceptional patient care, responsiveness and innovation.""\n\nBenefits of in-home neurodiagnostic services\n\nThe core service of Stratus has been its in-home, ambulatory video EEG service. Stratus\' software, hardware and monitoring services allow patients the privacy, convenience and comfort of video EEG testing in their own home. Backed by research, the quality and diagnostic accuracy of an in-home video EEG study can be similar to that of an inpatient diagnostic evaluation at an epilepsy monitoring unit in a hospital or health care facility. In-home video EEG is significantly less expensive than inpatient video EEG. And Stratus provides the ordering physician a diagnostic report within days of the study\'s completion.\n\nIn addition, Stratus provides home sleep studies and mobile cardiac telemetry testing to aid physicians in obtaining all the information they may need to make an accurate diagnosis.\n\n""From the inception of our company, Stratus has been committed to innovation in order to ensure outstanding patient care, access to our services and affordable costs,"" said Jeremy Slater, M.D., chief medical officer of Stratus. ""Those things check all the boxes for insurance providers, physicians and patients alike, and we believe they reflect our desire to reduce the patient care cycle, improve clinical outcomes and to constantly lead and improve the industry as a whole.""\n\nFor more information on Stratus, please visit www.stratusneuro.com .\n\nAbout Stratus\n\nStratus provides neurodiagnostic testing solutions and technologies that serve to expedite patient diagnoses and care, enabling physicians to improve patients\' quality of life. Services provided include routine EEG services and long-term video-monitored EEG studies in the inpatient, ambulatory and in-home settings.

Register now for the 8th annual MobileBeat[1], July 13-14, where the best and brightest will be exploring the latest strategies and tactics in the mobile space. ANALYSIS: Logitech[2] is probably one of the best-known creators of PC and tablet accessories, but the Swiss company made an interesting announcement [3]yesterday: It's ditching the 'tech' from its brand name and running with 'Logi' instead. \n\nWhile some reports[4] suggested that Logitech had changed its name completely from 'Logitech' to 'Logi,' it seems that's not quite the case \xe2\x80\x94 not yet, at least. The company's name will remain the same, but the name you see on some keyboards, mouses, and other peripherals will be 'Logi', with a longer-term vision to tag all its products with the new four-letter brand. This could also lead to a complete company name-change in the future, but it looks like they're staying safe for now by seeing how the new sub-brand performs. <nl/>Play Video[5] With more than 30 years worth of history and more than $2 billion in revenue last year, would such a rebrand be commercial suicide? Possibly \xe2\x80\x94 those who missed the press release might assume it's a copycat, looking to emulate a long-established company. But that's why Logitech\xc2\xa0isn't going all-in on a new brand yet \xe2\x80\x94 it's testing the water to see how things pan out. There has been a slew of brand name changes of late \xe2\x80\x94 just this week, Microsoft revealed it was switching[6] 'Xbox Music' to 'Groove' and 'Xbox Video' to 'Movies ....' This came just a few months after news emerged that Internet Explorer would be transitioned to Microsoft Edge[7]. Google, too, recently rebranded[8] Webmaster Tools as Google Search Console, as the company sought to target a broader user base. But product brand changes are different to company name changes. Often, a company will change a product name if it feels it is 'tarnished' somehow, either due to a bad reputation it can't shake off, or the product has evolved beyond what it was originally intended for. You only have to look at U.K. mobile phone retailer Carphone Warehouse[9] as proof of the power of a company's brand name \xe2\x80\x94 it\xc2\xa0hasn't sold car phones in a long, long time. And following a recent merger with Dixons Retail[10], you would think that would be an apt time to ditch the 'Carphone' element of the name \xe2\x80\x94 but alas, no. The parent company is now called 'Dixons Carphone.' For real. For a company to go all in and change the name of the entire organization would be a major move, and it's a decision that's never taken lightly. There has to be a very good reason for it. With that in mind, here's a look at 9 organizations that have changed their name in recent times, and some of the reasons that led them to do so. 1. Research in Motion (RIM) >> BlackBerry Former smartphone giant Research in Motion (RIM) rebranded as BlackBerry[11] back in 2013. BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins said at the announcement event: 'It is one brand, it is one promise.' While the move may have surprised some, it also made absolute sense \xe2\x80\x94 most people recognize the BlackBerry mobile phone brand. Indeed, it's safe to say most people wouldn't even have known the name of the company behind BlackBerry. With RIM looking for easy wins in its quest to stop the rot caused by its failure to innovate when confronted with the rise of Android and iOS, a rebrand wasn't the worst decision, though its impact has been minimal. 2. RapExegesis >> Rap Genius >> Genius Rap Genius started out as RapExegesis in 2009, with a small team annotating and explaining rap lyrics. Following its swift rebrand to Rap Genius in late 2009, the company gained traction aided by funding and participation in the Y Combinator accelerator. The company's evolution continued in 2013 when news emerged that it was expanding beyond rap lyrics, covering poetry, news, and rock music too. So the rebrand simply to 'Genius' last July probably made sense[12] \xe2\x80\x94 it was no longer a company focused on rap music. 3. Isis >> Softcard Isis was a mobile payments joint venture created by AT...Verizon, and T-Mobile, built upon contactless NFC technology \xe2\x80\x94 tap your mobile device on a payment terminal and the payment is processed. However, with the rise of the extremist militant group[13] of the same name, Isis saw fit to\xc2\xa0change its name[14] to Softcard \xe2\x80\x94 which is probably a better name anyway. The name change was a no-brainer, really, as its association with ISIS would have caused unnecessary hassle and confusion for a brand that was trying to pave the way for carrier-led mobile payments. The organization later revealed it was working with Apple[15] with a view towards launching on iPhones, but Google ended up acquiring Softcard's assets[16] to remove the friction from its own Google Wallet. Softcard was discontinued in March this year, with the carriers electing to back Google's new Android Pay instead. 4. Justin.tv >> Twitch Justin.tv was a live video-streaming startup that emerged from Y Combinator in 2007. Of the many different activities being streamed on the platform, one particular niche grew to eventually swallow Justin.tv whole \xe2\x80\x94 esports. Or, to you and me, watching other people play video games on the Internet. What began as a new standalone service called TwitchTV in 2011 blossomed into a major force[17], and last February Justin.tv and TwitchTV merged under the same corporate name \xe2\x80\x94 Twitch Interactive. However, Justin.tv was closed down altogether last August[18] ahead of Amazon's billion-dollar Twitch acquisition[19]. Similar to RIM and BlackBerry, it made sense for Justin.tv to chance its name to Twitch, given that Twitch had taken on a whole new life of its own and it was clear there was big money to be made here. 5. Clear Channel >> iHeartRadio Clear Channel was a decades-old media company that built an empire out of FM radio and related commercial activities. But facing the rise of digital music services such as Spotify, Clear Channel rebranded to iHeartMedia last year[20], named after the company's iHeartRadio Internet radio platform. For a media company that bought its first FM radio station in the early Seventies, it was clear there was concern around how its brand was perceived in the digital age. In its corporate press release, iHeartMedia was eager to point to the fact that it hit 50 million registered users 'faster than any digital music service' \xe2\x80\x94 though that doesn't necessary translate into active users or revenues. The rebrand made sense, though \xe2\x80\x94 out with the old, and in with the new. 6. DeSoto >> FlywheelTaxi Similar to Clear Channel's predicament, one of San Francisco's oldest taxi companies, DeSoto, changed its name to FlyWheelTaxi[21] earlier this year to appeal to the smartphone-toting generation. The cab company, which had been around since the 1930s, partnered with taxi-hailing app Flywheel in a move that saw 'FlyWheelTaxi' emblazoned across its 220-strong fleet of cars. This was a bold move for an age-old company, but with so many pre-digital era firms falling by the wayside[22] due to digital technology, it clearly felt a snappier name and affiliation with a heavily VC-funded[23] Uber-style company was the way to survive. 7. Elance-oDesk >> Upwork Two giants in the online crowdsourcing space, Elance and oDesk, merged[24] in December 2013 to create a freelancer-marketplace behemoth. At the time, it made sense to call the new company Elance-oDesk, but fresh from a $30 million funding round[25], the company rebranded as Upwork[26]. While the rebrand was accompanied by new features, such as a Slack-style messaging tool, the name change also made sense. The double-barrel effort was a mouthful, and the company was clearly looking to push forward under a single, unified brand \xe2\x80\x94 one that didn't reek of 'merger.' 8. McAfee >> Intel Security More than four years after Intel acquired computer security software company McAfee for almost $8 billion, Intel ditched the McAfee name[27] and plumped for 'Intel Security' instead. So, why the change of heart after so long as a separately branded subsidiary? There are a number of reasons. On the one hand, Intel wanted to better align itself with the security fraternity. But perhaps more than that, McAfee founder \xe2\x80\x94 John McAfee \xe2\x80\x94 had become\xc2\xa0a controversial figure, chiefly around an alleged murder in Belize[28] which resulted in (John) McAfee going on the run for a while. So: a fresh start for the McAfee brand. 9. 10gen >> MongoDB MongoDB, the leading NoSQL database provider, is another example of how a product can usurp the company that created it. Indeed, 10gen rebranded as MongoDB in 2013[29], shortly before closing a whopping $150 million funding round[30]. It's likely the name change was expedited due to the impending funding \xe2\x80\x94 after all, if a company is known chiefly for one key product, then why not just change the company's name to reflect that? It makes commercial sense. Logitech's thinking Logitech is a respected brand in the computing accessory realm, but it's hardly a sexy brand. However, having hired former Nokia chief designer Alastair Curtis back in 2013, the company has been working on 'reinventing' itself. This means you can expect smarter designers, 'bold colors,' and a more distinctive look-and-feel. 'We've been reinventing Logitech, creating products that strive to blend advanced technology and design to bring you amazing experiences,' said Bracken Darrell, Logitech's president and CEO. 'We've built a world-class design team, led by chief designer Alastair Curtis. We're putting design at the center of everything we do. Our approach to design goes beyond the classic definition. Design to us is the combination of advanced technology, business strategy, and consumer insights. Our products have come a long way, and now it's time to bring the brand forward too.' So 'Logi' will be dripped out into the product realm, and it seems the company is taking baby steps before making wholesale changes to the company name.

The biggest change to the business came about two years ago, it was the complete renaming and rebranding of the company.\n\nThe business had been born from trips to the supermarket and seeing the fruits all the same size and wrapped in plastic.\n\n""We started to do a bit more research on what we consume, particularly fruit and vegetables, and what happened to the fruits that were rejected,"" explained Ms Sudenyte. ""This is when we decided to approach farmers about where all of those fruits end up and discovered how much waste there was. We were shocked at what we discovered and decided we needed to make a change.""\n\nThe business was originally named Get Wonky, as the pair used \'wonky\' fruits that were not being sold to make their fruit drinks.\n\nMs Sudenyte, 25, and Mr Kacprzyk, 28, who are originally from Lithuania and Poland respectively, had met while at the University of South Wales and came up with their business plan.\n\nThey wanted to stay in Wales because they felt the country helps and nurtures entrepreneurs. At the start they accessed assistance from Big Ideas Wales, which is part of the Welsh Government\'s Business Wales Service and is part-funded by the European Regional Development Fund, Accelerated Growth Programme and the Entrepreneurial Spark powered by NatWest programme. Get Wonky was doing well, they were supplying caterers, Filco supermarkets, and a number of venues across the country.\n\nHowever, the pair felt it was failing to stand out in a marketplace. With\n\nMorrisons\' wonky boxes making headlines the young entrepreneurs felt their business was being associated with the big supermaket.\n\n""We were losing distinctiveness and we always wanted to have this, so this is when we started to think about having a rebrand,"" said Ms Sudenyte.\n\nThis is where fate played its hand. ""We would never be able to afford such a rebrand. We were often helping students to gain experience and one day we came across a girl asking for a graphic design job and if we can accept her to do some freelance work for us. It turned out her mum was a creative director at the Coley Porter Bell, part of Ogilvy. Of course we had to pitch to the board of Ogilvy in order to convince them. We were in the right time and moment, and we were so lucky they have invested their time and money for a significantly reduced rate of the amount we would never afford to pay.""\n\nMs Sudenyte says that while they were lucky to get the opportunity, the decision for the agency to rebrand the company has been justified. The work on changing Get Wonky to Flawsome! won a gold\n\nDBA award earlier this year.\n\nThe Design Business Association (DBA) has been measuring success, sharing excellence and best practice in design effectiveness for more than 30 years and the global scheme recognises wide-ranging examples of design across all sectors and disciplines. The Coley Porter Bell agency winning this award is a real honour and the company was hailed for its work.\n\nGet Wonky was distributed by six wholesalers, but leapt to 21 following the redesign, including the largest German supermarket, Edeka, as well as Carrefour and Ad Delhaize in Belgium. The business had also been seeking to secure external investment, but rebranded as Flawsome! it acquired eight investors, while it enabled new product developments, further increasing distribution and sales.\n\nMs Sudenyte says that while they were lucky to get the opportunity the decision for the agency to rebrand the company has been justified. The work also pointed out the award was not solely about design, but also linked to the sustainable and environmental work the company does.\n\n""Brands need a social and environmental purpose at their heart to engage with their generation, the Z\'s and the Millennials, and a third of consumers care more about the environment than they did five years ago,"" explained Ms Sudenyte.\n\nStarting Flawesome! for Ms Sudenyte and Mr Kacprzyk wasn\'t all about making juice, it was about making a a positive impact on everything they did.\n\nThe pair work closely with small to medium-sized farms struggling or that had surplus, so that way they help out each other. Flawsome! also works with Fare Share, a national network of charitable food redistributors. The company has donated 33,000 portions of juice to the scheme, and the plan is to reach one million donations in the next three years.\n\n""Giving back for social good in line with our values,"" says Ms Sudenyte.\n\nThe Flawsome! story is not only socially and environmentally good but has also helped the company win new partners. Ms Sudenyte says it helped the company win the contracts in Germany and Belgium where a back story is important for retailers.\n\nThe outbreak of Covid-19 and the subsequent lockdown has seen a change of direction for the company, with Flawsome using Amazon to go direct to the client (DTC).\n\n""We had never traded on Amazon,"" said Ms Sudenyte.\n\n""It was not our priority, we were focused on food services, and outlets such as restaurants and universities.""\n\nWhile Amazon has not recouped the sales lost during the lockdown period it has had the benefit of helping build the brand with consumers.\n\nThis period has also seen Flawsome! look more closely at the spirits and mixers market, something they might not have done without lockdown. There sparkling range has proved popular and has been included in craft gin clubs.\n\nIt has also given them time to think of new and unusual opportunites. ""There are 20,000 pumpkins going to waste every year at Hallowe\'en,"" says Ms Sudenyte. ""We have started approaching retailers with a proposition and have had good feedback.""\n\nWhatever happens, Ms Sudenyte is adament the business will keep its philosophy. It\'s a philosophy that saw the pair named on the Forbes Under 30 Europe Social Entrepreneurs, along with Greta Thunberg.\n\nMs Sudenyte does not want the business to become mainstream.\n\n""We are more about educating and also doing our bit for environment. It\'s about remaining sustainable, zero waste, and fair trade, we will not dilute that. For us it is extremely important to stay where we are, it\'s all about creating awareness.\n\n""Flawsome! is on a mission to make other people as passionate about sustainable drinks as we are.""\n\nBrands need a social and environmental purpose at their heart to engage with their generation, the Z\'s and the Millennials, and a third of consumers care more about the environment than they did five years ago KARINA SUDENYTE\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nFlawsome - formerly Get Wonky - use mishaped and surplus fruit to make their drinksKarina Sudenyte and Maciek Kacprzyk founders of Flawsome! drinks\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 22, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Snappy rebrand of eco drinks sees firm reap fruits of labours,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=d3dc0eab-2e49-4601-879f-c4ef62c91bf3&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60WY-CP21-DYTY-C0BB-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=244366&pdteaserkey=sr5&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr5&prid=8ab92546-c4e0-4bc0-b0a8-72244d974b1e,2020-09-23,1.0

It\xe2\x80\x99s hard. But who knew it was this hard? I took a look at other instances over the years when logo redesigns didn\xe2\x80\x99t go over as planned.\n\nThe New England-based retailer, founded by two brothers and known for its positive affirmations, deployed this unfortunate logo redesign in 2015.\n\nThe Brand New blog noted that, \xe2\x80\x9cchanging the logo from that quirky typography to something much more\xc2\xa0normal\xc2\xa0seems like a very risky move since what makes [this brand] so recognizable is that goopy type.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0 The author also speculated that perhaps now-adults who grew up with Life is Good no longer wanted to sport the original design\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchild-like graphics.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMaturing the brand along with its base may not have had the intended effect\xe2\x80\x94suddenly, it seemed everything the brand stood for\xe2\x80\x94a fun, carefree outlook on life; a charitable mission\xe2\x80\x94had been reduced to an ugly yellow blob of hopelessness, that had people saying, \xe2\x80\x9cLife is good, but this logo is not.\xe2\x80\x9d Better child-like than boring.\n\nSometimes a brand should simply stick to what it knows best. Gap is known by its customers for basic, dependable designs\xe2\x80\x94not groundbreaking fashion statements. Someone should perhaps have relayed this fact to the designer tasked with Gap\xe2\x80\x99s unsuccessful 2010 rebranding. Customers turn to Gap because they know what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to get, which is perhaps why this stab at creativity was met with outrage.\n\nAccording to the BBC, the online backlash was so severe\xc2\xa0that after less than one week the logo was \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cconsigned to the graveyard inhabited by rejected arrows, squiggles and inadvertently offensive corporate emblems.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0The old logo was promptly restored and Gap\xe2\x80\x99s tale went down in history as a caution to other brands.\n\nA logo that advertises food or beverages should look, well, appetizing. This tough-on-the-eyes Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Best redesign from 2010 looks like an advert for a blood drive. Which is fine if you\xe2\x80\x99re a vampire. But somehow I have a feeling that\xe2\x80\x99s not the company\xe2\x80\x99s dominant customer base.\n\nOpponents of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s Best rendering in the design world called it \xe2\x80\x9ctoo clinical\xe2\x80\x9d and the Seattle Weekly called it a \xe2\x80\x9ccross between Target and the Red Cross.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0Critics said the coffee brand\xe2\x80\x99s previous logo had a nostalgic, vintage feel that consumers cherished, while the new design was too generic to invoke fond memories, and could have been advertising pretty much anything. \n\nIn 2009, Pepsi allegedly paid $1 million to have its time-honored logo turned 45 degrees. The Arnell Group, which was responsible for this metamorphosis, said in a statement: \xe2\x80\x9cThe vocabulary of truth and simplicity is a reoccurring phenomena in the brand\xe2\x80\x99s history. It communicates the brand in a timeless manner and with an expression of clarity.\xc2\xa0Pepsi BREATHTAKING builds on this knowledge. True innovation always begins by investigating the historic path. Going back-to-the-roots moves the brand forward as it changes the trajectory of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCritics said the new design bore a striking resemblance to a fat little balloon man.\xc2\xa0\n\nThis one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly fit with the retailer trend, but I would have been remiss to leave it out.

Even though a revamped logo might mean spending a lot of money due to the new design having to be reflected everywhere and there is huge risk involved in it, the attempt is to always to stay connected to consumers amidst what is a fiercely competitive environment.\n\nProminent e-commerce site Snapdeal recently unveiled its new brand identity where along with major brand repositioning, it has also changed its logo. It was done just ahead of the upcoming festive season and the on-going Diwali sale wars between several brands across the board. Snapdeal has done away with its blue and red logo, replacing it with a red box. More than Rs 200 crore has been invested by the company on this major rebranding exercise, as the brand focuses on its next phase of growth.\n\nCommenting on whether a logo revamp can help change the fortunes of a brand, Harish Bijoor, brand-expert and founder, Harish Bijoor Consults, said, ""Yes, it does. Brand logo changes make the brand contemporary and in sync with the new set of consumers who seem to be always seeking out the new in the old. It can help keep the brand in the limelight of today rather than let it only bask in the glory of yesterday.""\n\nHandset manufacturers Gionee and Micromax too changed their logo during the IPL tournament earlier this year where they were also the major sponsors. Some of the other notable brands that have gone in for a logo revamp this year are Tata Sky, Aditya Birla Group, Truecaller and Channel V. In 2015, we saw Flipkart rebranding itself several times with a new logo change. Also PayU Money spent about Rs 66 crore to bifurcate the two brands PayU Money and PayU Biz through two different logos.\n\nWe spoke to some advertising and brand experts in order to understand what factors should be kept in mind before a brand\'s logo is decided to be changed, how it helps a company, instances where consumers haven\'t accepted the change easily and how to make them feel connected with also being in line with the brand\'s core strategy and principle.\n\nHow does logo revamp help a brand?\n\nSantosh Padhi, co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Taproot Dentsu, said, ""Sometimes, the personality of the brand has changed and the current logo might be irrelevant to the TG. It is then that brands decide to work on their logo because it gets exposed in millions of places, right from visiting card to the biggest hoardings in town. So if your logo doesn\'t have a personality in today\'s age and day when everything is so competitive, you might end up losing the mind-space of the consumers.""\n\nHe says that sometimes logo revamp is an evolutionary process and also that a logo is what differentiates one brand from another in a cluttered market like India. ""Start-ups sometimes don\'t realise that they may becoming big one day, so initially many end up neglecting the potential of a good logo. But when the brand becomes a \'brand\' and with the investors\' money coming in, they later decide to work on the logo to connect well with the consumers. For instance, during Diwali, there will be five e-commerce brands who will be advertising but the creatives look almost the same because it will be only about the deals (offered), so if the logo of a brand is not powerful enough, the brand will not register in the minds of the consumers,"" he added.\n\nKV Sridhar, Chief Creative Officer, Sapient Nitro, said, ""Changing the logo of a brand totally depends on the type of brand. Some might want to reboot and have a fresher look, like Uber, True Caller and Snapdeal. A lot of the modern companies want to do it because they want to pump in a lot of energy in the market. However, the old brands are scared of experimenting due the fear of losing franchise and affinity. With the rise in spurious products, consumers might hesitate to accept (the product or service) or may lose connect with the new logo. In such cases, brands keep close to the familiarity factor and prefer to make minor changes, so as not to offend people easily or even break their long-standing trust with the company.""\n\nAccording to Kishore Karumbaiah, CCO and Partner, Langoor,logos are to brands what tattoos are to anyone of us. Once you\'re inked, it\'s a painful and risky process to get it off or cover it up. The same goes with logos and that\'s why established brands don\'t change their logos often. There\'s a lot at stake. And even if the logo were to be changed, the process involves a lot of planning, research and foresight. For instance, after six years, Snapdeal recently unveiled a new logo and changed the brand proposition to \'Unbox Zindagi\'. This comes at a time when they have been slipping down considerably compared to their competitors. So, it makes sense to come back in a new avatar, in a new suit of armour, with a fresh promise and attack the market like a new brand.\n\nIs the change always noticeable for consumers?\n\nKarumbaiah added, ""Some brands make very subtle changes which are not really noticeable whereas some brands go all out and come back with a brand new look. It takes a while to digest the new look especially if the consumer is loyal. It sure does take time to connect.""\n\nHayden Scott, Creative Director, Famous Innovations, feels that sometimes the change can be a minor tweak but consumers do connect with it because they are interacting and communicating with the brand on a daily basis.\n\nWhen can it backfire?\n\nThere have been instances when getting in a new logo has backfired. When Air India changed its logo and removed the Maharaja, it was not accepted easily by the customers and there was a lot of hue and cry. Popular clothing brand Gap also had to resort back to its original logo which had been there for more than 40 years, after a lot ofFacebookand Twitter protests. Sridhar said, ""This may happen sometimes if the affinity of the brand is too strong with the audience. At the end of the day, brands have to bow down to what consumers want.""\n\nKarumbaiah said, ""A brand\'s logo is sacred. When you take the chance of changing it, you never know where you\'re going to end up. You might think you\'ve hit the jackpot but your customers might think otherwise. That\'s a risk but it is also a brand\'s greatest learning experience. Sometimes it\'s difficult to get the logo and positioning right the first time, that\'s when most brands dive right in to undergo a transformation. However, even then, they\'re not sure if everyone is going to warm up to that change. If a re-branding exercise fails, that\'s a lot of marketing budget wasted and this might snowball into people shying away from the brand thus affecting sales.""\n\nFactors which need to be kept in mind before changing the logo:\n\nScott said, ""One needs to ask themselves these questions before deciding a logo revamp- Do you really need a logo change? What stage in its life cycle is your brand in? If its well-established then do you really need to rock the apple cart? And what do you stand to gain by getting a logo change? If a brand is entering a new phase in its life then maybe a logo change is necessary. If it\'s been stagnating for a while, a mere logo change won\'t do a thing, you need a complete brand overhaul. In that case a logo change is just one part of it. A new logo is a huge commitment, one that needs to be approved and liked by all stakeholders that too before going live.""\n\nBijoor points out that while changing a logo, it is important to remember that the logo has to be driven by the brand\'s strategy rather than the other way round. ""When you invest in logo change, be sure to invest in brand strategy much before that. If brand-strategy can dictate logo changes, the guarantee of success is much higher than just mere tinkering with the font, colour and tagline. In my company, we do not do logos at all. Instead, we build brand strategy that leads to the logo at times,"" he said.\n\nThat a lot of decision making is involved before it is decided that a brand\'s logo needs to be changed is a given as it is what a brand is first known and identified by. Also it is important to observe how people interact with your brand in order to identify signs of whether you need a minor tweak in the existing logo or a complete brand overhaul.  \n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0CONSUMERS (90%); BRANDING (90%); COMPANY STRATEGY (78%); EXECUTIVES (73%); DIWALI (70%); ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (56%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 ADITYA BIRLA GROUP (54%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); IMAGE MARKETING & ADVERTISING (78%); SPONSORSHIP (78%); CORPORATE POSITIONING (78%); MARKETING & ADVERTISING (76%); OUTDOOR ADVERTISING (65%); ELECTRONIC COMMERCE (56%); WIRELESS & BROADCAST EQUIPMENT MFG (50%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MFG (50%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0October 3, 2016\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",How a logo change can impact a brand's identity and fortunes_.docx,,,0.0

Now imagine that your business just happens to be helping your customers cheat on their spouses. \n\nHello, Ashley Madison. The affair-enabling site announced today[1] that its parent company is changing its name from Avid Life Media to Ruby[2]. Also, Ashley Madison has decided to drop its 'Life is short. Have an affair.' motto in favor of 'Find your moment.' 'It's a new day at Ruby and renaming our topco is an important step in our journey to completely rebuild the company as a relevant, digital dating innovator that truly cares for our customers,' said new Ruby\xc2\xa0CEO Rob Segal in a statement. The previous CEO\xc2\xa0Noel Biderman\xc2\xa0left the company last September after hackers\xc2\xa0broke in the company's databases and posted user info on the Internet. The hacking group was trying to get the company to shut down the site. The company is still facing an FTC investigation[3] into the incident. Of the new corporate name, the company's new president James Millership\xc2\xa0said in a statement:\xc2\xa0'Modern relationships are multi-faceted and that's why we chose ruby as our new name.\xc2\xa0We like that ruby has a sensual, feminine quality, connotes value and fits with the fresh start our company is undergoing.' In a general sense, the company says it plans to evolve the service to 'grow and attune to modern sexuality in 2016.' 'It was a limiting label that's out-dated and doesn't speak to the wide variety of connections people find on Ashley Madison,' Segal said in his statement.\xc2\xa0'Close to 45 percent of our members are single, over 50 percent are attached and they are interested in a wide range of experiences.' The company will be also rolling out a new TV ad campaign and posted the new videos online[4], which feature a bored woman considering a hookup at a hotel, a bored couple considering a three-way, and a bored guy on a subway flirting with a woman. Apparently none of these people have discovered Pokemon Go or they couldn't be so bored and alone.

But I really don't look the same at all. \n\nI wear my dress differently, I like different types of clothes, I use different type of accessories, I read different kind of books (even though I keep my lifetime favorites), you know what I meanwe change with time, even though we are the same people. Well our brands must do the same in order to stay relevant and keep growing. But when should we refresh our brand's look? After sending my question into the Google Search universe it was evident that the answer exists within each brand as they are alive and evolving like their owners and customers; or to be more specific for our writers; Authors' brands and their audience should grow and evolve together. Below are some of the trends of thought I found on when to refresh your brand's look.  Every now and then, as often as you can? Really? Yup, often is good. Some experts say 18 months to 2.5 years; others say 3-4 years. In my opinion though, we should be careful not to overdo it and lose your brand's identity. There needs to be a balance so that the people that follow you can still recognize you. Too much too often might also be confusing or off putting. So use common sense and hold on a little longer if the brand's design doesn't feel outdated or stalling.  Your Vision or Mission has changed; or after a major event - This one to me makes sense, and feels actually necessary. In fact, it has been one of the catalysts for some of the changes some of you might have noticed happening slowly but surely on our websites, newsletter, and even Literary Awards.  Your Brand is not working or there are flaws in the design - Sometimes we design a brand and keep tweaking correcting flaws for months and even years trying to make it work to no avail. This only produces unhappy customers and unreached goals, so rebranding is the best tool to start over having learned from your mistakes.Reader Views and affiliates have been around since 2005 adapting to change and evolving with our Authors and Audience for 15 years. We think it is time to refresh our brand across the board. There will be changes, we will look differentbut it will still be us! Just better, with a slicker look, still offering personal attention to our readers and authors book by book. The Great Reveal is coming soon! For more information subscribe to our newsletter [1].

No matter where a brand organization is on its digital transformation journey, ResultsCX helps to grow revenue, reduce costs, and deliver a resolution-centered, differentiated customer experience.\n\nThe former DeviceBits software products have been renamed under the ResultsCX moniker. Academy, a self-support web-based knowledge center, is now known as SupportPredict Self Service; CareAssist, an intelligent agent assistance and live agent chat/messaging resource, is now SupportPredict Agent AI; and Bot+, an AI-powered chatbot with agent transfer functionality is now SupportPredict Bots.\n\nContinued Growth of AI & Bot CX TechnologiesAI-powered customer resolution technologies and chatbots have grown increasingly important to leading businesses. Over 80% of companies expect to compete primarily based on their customer experience this year, up from only 36% in 20101. Furthermore, companies that are leading in customer experience are three times more likely to have significantly exceeded their 2019 business goals2.\n\n""Brands today are quickly realizing that in order to maintain proper customer service levels, and to support the increasing remote workforce population of contact center staff, leading AI- and bot-centric solutions must be available to both customers and agents,"" said Wayne White, chief information officer for ResultsCX. ""These leading technologies are amplifying the overall branded customer experience that feature self-support for general and high-volume customer questions; intelligent agent assistance with live agent chat and messaging; and an AI-powered chatbot with transfer functionality for special technical or emotional issues.""\n\nResultsCX solutions improve overall CX efficiency without sacrificing the human element through a balanced human/digital CX model: self-service and bot technology work in concert to make transactional support easy and AI-empowered human engagement teams to resolve complex or emotional customer needs.\n\nSolutions for At-Home CX AgentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has drastically disrupted the way brands handle contact center operations. ResultsCX works with brand partners and leverages AI and bot technology to transition part or an entire CX operation to home-based agents without disrupting customer engagement levels. Results Home Office mobilizes its PHI and PCI-compliant data center, HIPAA and HITECH-compliant practices, and CX360 management system to deliver the same quality and stability customers expect from brick-and-mortar CX operations.\n\nHelping Healthcare Brands Resolve Customer InquiriesHealthcare organizations constantly face a large number of customer inquiries, even pre-pandemic. Issues such as noncompliance penalties, low customer satisfaction, high repeat-call volumes, inadequate resolution rates due to inexperience in healthcare support; and sub-optimal sales revenue are all overcome through ResultsCX solutions.\n\n""There are a lot of situations today where the customer wants the ease of self-support functionality to resolve their own issue online,"" added White. ""However, there are an equal number of more technical or emotionally sensitive issues where the customer still wants the chance to speak with a live agent. No matter your customer\'s needs, we have the right solution to achieve resolution.""\n\nTo learn more about ResultsCX and its complete line of resolution-centered technologies please visit www.results-cx.com.\n\nAbout Us ResultsCXFor three decades, ResultsCX has been a premier customer experience partner to Fortune 100 and 500 companies.

At the time, the business operated under the direction of a lone freelancer as a sole proprietorship.\n\n\n\nIt started how most online service providers begin their journey, by using job boards, online freelance communities, forums, and networking with local businesses. In other words, leads were sought in any and every way imaginable. Cold outreach and prospecting was a daily hustle, and existing clients were practically hounded for referrals.\n\n\n\nThat daily grind quickly grew from a one-man operation into a small-time agency. Dylan Bozeman, the lead service provider and founder of the business, started to see room for growth. As a business, they began contracting work to freelancers of their own, hiring virtual assistants, and dreaming of a bigger and brighter future.\n\n\n\nSpecializing in various digital marketing services, they strived to provide what few agencies have managed to accomplish, providing genuine and continuous value to their clients. With advertising services like pay-per-click marketing as their forefront offering, that meant monthly auditing of client accounts, keyword research, ad copywriting, landing page design, and even conversion optimization by A/B split testing their pages. They set out to change the way businesses viewed managed PPC providers and to offer the type of value that their competitors couldn\'t.\n\n\n\nIt was a lot to provide under one roof and that responsibility grew even further as more services became cornerstones to their success.\n\n\n\nThe businesses they worked with often wanted to expand online through services such as display advertising, search engine marketing, and social media. These were all paid advertising models that delivered immediate results. However, as ads were optimized and improved, the profitability of the businesses they served increased, and suddenly, those same businesses were interested in other services as well.\n\n\n\nSuccessful ad campaigns often led to businesses inquiring about organic opportunities such as content marketing, SEO, and other forms of inbound lead generation.\n\n\n\nIt became apparent that a full-service agency was the only solution to helping these businesses get the most out of their digital marketing investments.\n\n\n\nHowever, this expansion of services came with unforeseen complications. Many businesses had trouble grasping the difference between online advertising and organic marketing. SEO and content marketing requiring thorough explanations and the hours of consultation that were needed to make this transition possible quickly began to overwhelm the sales team.\n\n\n\nEmpowermented was born with the goal of separating technical consulting from the services, by providing advanced consultation packages. These guides would thoroughly teach everything there is to know about digital marketing. The resources developed would also be categorized by their appropriate digital marketing model - SEO, PPC, content marketing, etc. This would effectively allow businesses to choose for themselves which model is right for their company and explore that topic to its depths.\n\n\n\nThrough classes and educational content, Empowermented\'s products provide the guidance and training that\'s needed for businesses to teach their marketing teams, or manage these areas on their own. Many businesses are looking for a better grasp of marketing concepts, but still want a team to manage their campaigns. The courses at Empowermented make that possible while decreasing the amount of live consultation needed to get a campaign off the ground.\n\n\n\nEmpowerment\'s founder, Dylan Bozeman, wanted a symbolic mascot for the new brand. What better than the gorilla, the most dominant animal of the jungle?\n\n\n\nGorillas are an undisputedly powerful great ape that are heavily-built and extremely large. They have incredible strength and an aggressive demeanor to match. Dylan felt their presence embodied the approach behind Empowermented\'s digital marketing services. He also recognized gorillas as a symbol for being an overwhelming contender in any operation or activity.\n\n\n\nIt\'s the gorilla\'s iconic presence that Dylan is hoping will command an influence for the brand, and represent their importance to the industry.\n\n\n\nIn his own words, Dylan acknowledged he\'s also a ""huge nerd and follower of paleontology. He\'s got a fascination for human evolution and its ancestral ties to other primates."" He confirmed that this alone is likely to have played a subconscious role in his decision to include the gorilla as the logo for the rebrand and the image behind their services.\n\n\n\nWith the business now officially located at Empowermented.com, there are many promising things on the horizon, and new guides expected shortly. Several previous brands of the business have been included in the rebrand, and these sites are said to be redirected appropriately. Over the coming weeks, expect Empowermented to be engaging with followers on social media and highlighting their exciting transition.\n\n\n\nMedia Contact\n\n\n\nCompany Name: Empowermented\n\n\n\nContact Person: Media Manager\n\n\n\nEmail: info@empowermented.com\n\n\n\nPhone: (206) 693-2639\n\n\n\nAddress:13110 NE 177th Pl #1007\n\n\n\nCity: Woodinville\n\n\n\nState: Washington\n\n\n\nCountry: United States\n\n\n\nWebsite: https://empowermented.com           \n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 9, 2018\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Empowermented Launches Rebranded Digital Marketing Business Using Gorilla Mascot,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=bb4d54f9-1794-41cd-8da3-2d222b7c6bfe&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5RCB-0S11-JD3Y-Y30B-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=162367&pdteaserkey=sr41&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr41&prid=ecf7130d-e2cd-475d-893a-34dc7c714dfc,2018-01-09,1.0

All Rights Reserved\n\nSection:\xc2\xa0COMPANY ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nLength:\xc2\xa01548 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn., Oct.  28, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Corrections Corporation of America\xc2\xa0(NYSE:CXW) (the ""Company"") today announced that it is rebranding its corporate enterprise as CoreCivic. Under the CoreCivic brand, the Company will provide three distinct business offerings: CoreCivic Safety, a national leader in high quality corrections and detention management; CoreCivic Properties, a wide range of innovative, cost-saving government real estate solutions; and CoreCivic Community, a growing network of residential reentry centers to help tackle America\'s recidivism crisis.\n\n""Rebranding as CoreCivic is the culmination of a multi-year strategy to transform our business from largely corrections and detention services to a wider range of government solutions,"" said Damon T. Hininger, the Company\'s President and Chief Executive Officer.\xc2\xa0""The CoreCivic name speaks to our ability to solve the tough challenges facing government at all levels and to the deep sense of service that we feel every day to help people.""\n\nThe CoreCivic Name: Solving Tough Government Problems; a Strong Sense of Service\n\nOver the past several years, Hininger and his executive management team have spearheaded an aggressive strategy to diversify the Company\'s business. This has included converting to a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), making unprecedented public commitments to expand reentry programs at correctional facilities, launching a comprehensive real estate solutions business, and investing nearly $250 million to acquire and build an expanding network of residential reentry and community corrections facilities.\n\n""We\'ve listened closely to our employees, partners and investors, and there\'s a strong recognition and appreciation for what we\'ve built over more than 30 years,"" said Hininger. ""At the same time, we know we can do even more to serve the needs of our government partners and the greater public good. CoreCivic reflects the company we are today and provides us with a platform to continue to grow where our partners want and need solutions.""\n\nThe Company\'s specific rebranding effort began when it decided to launch a new, dedicated real estate solutions business in mid-2015. As the Company continued to acquire residential reentry businesses, the effort rapidly evolved into considering an enterprise-wide name change. After an intense research, brand strategy and creative process, the Board of Directors authorized changing the Company\'s charter to reflect the CoreCivic name on August 11, 2016, which the Company intends to be legally effected by year-end. The name change will not affect the rights of the Company\'s stockholders and the Company\'s common stock ticker symbol on the New York Stock Exchange will remain unchanged.\n\n""The management team has successfully executed a well-planned strategy to diversify the business, and rebranding became a natural evolution of that process,"" said\xc2\xa0Mark A. Emkes, Non-Executive Chairman of the Company\'s Board of Directors. ""We\'re excited about the potential for the CoreCivic brand to accelerate the Company\'s growth and value-creation in new areas. We also believe the new brand will help galvanize our efforts to play an even bigger role in making a positive difference in our communities and individual lives.""\n\nCoreCivic\'s Visual Identity: Innovation, Public Service and Professionalism\n\nAs part of the rebranding, the Company has also adopted a new visual identity. This includes a bolder, sleeker and more modern typeface, as well as a color palette intended to evoke attributes such as safety, strength, passion, stability, integrity and seriousness. The brand\'s symbol, a 13-stripe American flag stylized to also represent a building, speaks to the Company\'s commitment to public service, the professionalism of its employees and its expanding government real estate focus. There\'s also a nod to the Company\'s heritage with the right side of the symbol angled at 19.83\xc3\x82\xc2\xb0, representing the year that the Company was founded, and the left side of the symbol angled at 20.16\xc3\x82\xc2\xb0 to mark the year the Company rebranded as CoreCivic.\n\n""Our government partners value the dependability and professionalism of our people, and our people share a deep sense of service with our government partners,"" said Executive Vice President and Chief Development Officer Tony Grande. ""Our new name and identity speak emotionally to our strengths while expanding the scope of solutions that we can offer our partners. We\'re excited about the work ahead to build and realize our new brand\'s full potential.""\n\nIn the coming months, the Company will begin converting its facilities and other assets to the new visual identity, which will amount to a modest expense spread out over several quarters. The Company does not anticipate any impact of the rebranding on its contractual relationships with government partners.\n\n""Government has core responsibilities that are vital for safe, healthy and thriving communities. But in our increasingly complex and budget-constrained world, performing these basic functions is becoming harder to do,"" added Hininger. ""For more than three decades, our company has been an innovative, dependable partner for government. As CoreCivic, we will continue to bring the scale, experience and professionalism needed to solve problems for our partners and serve the greater public good.""\n\nAbout the Company\n\nThe Company is a diversified government solutions company with the scale and experience needed to solve tough government challenges in cost-effective ways. We provide a broad range of solutions to government partners that serve the public good through high-quality corrections and detention management, innovative and cost-saving government real estate solutions, and a growing network of residential reentry centers to help address America\'s recidivism crisis. We are a publicly traded real estate investment trust (REIT) and the nation\'s largest owner of partnership correctional, detention and residential reentry facilities. The Company has been a flexible and dependable partner for government for more than 30 years.

Rebranding isn't a quick-fix; nor is it a miracle solution to all of a company's problems.However, when done well, a rebrand can dramatically improve a business's reputation and viability[1]. Here, we'll explain the five key benefits associated with rebranding, as well as what you can do to ensure your rebrand goes as smoothly as possible:Chance to ResetUnderstandably, the most obvious advantage of a rebrand is that it allows a company to hit the reset button, so to speak. \n\nRebranding gives businesses the power to control the conversation about their goals, values, and future. It's worth noting that a rebrand won't erase what happened in the past; it will, though, give professionals the opportunity to put things right that have gone wrong previously.Enhanced VisibilityWhen a company rebrands, it changes virtually everything about its appearance. Ideally, this should help a company become more visible and recognizable. Introducing a quality logo[2], for instance, can make it easier for consumers to remember your brand. What's more, many businesses alter the appearance of their website during a rebrand in order to appeal to consumers.New FocusIn general, most businesses focus on one or two demographics when they market a product or a service. This is a good practice. After all, the more specific your targeting efforts are, the better chance you have of converting the leads you generate. Sometimes, though, companies want to shift gears and 'go after' a new demographic or two. A rebrand affords companies the opportunity to reach out to new customers in an organic way. Rebranding signals that you've changed, and as such, are open to courting a new type of consumer.Stronger IdentityHave you ever encountered a group of businesses that looked, spoke, and acted in a nearly identical manner? If your brand bears a strong resemblance to those of your competitors, then changing things up can help you stand out[3] from the crowd and realize a new, stronger identity. Remember, it's always beneficial for a company to be eye catching!Increased RevenueAt the end of the day, a rebrand can and should deliver increased revenue as a result of greater exposure. True, rebrands are about ushering in a big change at your company, but they're also designed to enhance a business's potential. No one rebrands to scale down.The Bottom LineThink your business is primed for a rebrand? Before you make any decision on rebranding, make sure to speak to an agency like Communications for Research[4] (CFR) first. Organizations like CFR will help you gain valuable consumer insights -- so that you can make smart marketing, branding, and PR choices moving forward!

Members of the Young Entrepreneur Council[1] discussed some of the key factors a company should take into account when planning a rebranding strategy. Here is what they said: 1. Know Your Brand StoryKnowing your brand story is essential to a rebrand. \n\nA great brand story serves as a call to arms for everything your company does and why it matters. Which means that you can bring others along with a compelling vision. You can give a voice to your company that helps shape your culture. You can always be consistent with your message. And ultimately, you can have a stronger story for new customers. - Ryan Stoner[2], Phenomenon[3]2. Remember Your Existing CustomersSometimes companies go through rebrands that leave their existing customer base wondering how they fit in with the new brand. The strategy error that is made is that companies tend to put too much focus on acquiring new customers, rather than how the new brand fits in with the expectations of their existing customers. Instead, make sure your existing base knows what's in it for them. - Ben Walker[4], Transcription Outsourcing, LLC3. Seek Feedback From Multiple SourcesMany companies think rebranding is a one-and-done type of thing. They have a designer create a handful of logos and call it a day. Successful rebranding can take time. Your rebranding efforts have to be all-encompassing. Your brand is more than just a logo or font. Everything you do should refer back your mission statement. - Jeff Pitta[5], Medicare Plan Finder[6]4. Study Your CompetitorsWhen planning your rebranding strategy, don't forget to check out your competitors. Pull the logos from your top competitors. Look at what they have in common but also look at what they're missing. By analyzing the brands of your competitors, you can come up with a rebranding strategy that will make your company stand out from the crowd. - John Turner[7], SeedProd LLC[8]5. Integrate Your New BrandingWhen rebranding, some companies make the mistake of just slapping their new name and logo on everything and calling it a day. But if you want your rebranding to be successful, you need to integrate it everywhere. For instance, you need to consider updating your internal processes to make sure they match your new brand as well. If your rebranding stops at 'the look' of your company, it won't work. - Stephanie Wells[9], Formidable Forms[10]6. Watch for SEO ImplicationsIf your company rebranding includes changing your website's name or page structure \xe2\x80\x94 like adding or changing your 'About Us' page or other website content \xe2\x80\x94 don't forget to keep the search engine optimization impact of your website changes in mind. You've likely spent valuable time ranking for various keywords and phrases, and you don't want your rebranding to set you back in the Google results. - Keith Shields[11], Designli[12]7. Reinforce Your Mission StatementIt's essential to stick to and remember the reasons you started your brand in the first place, and a great way to do this is by reinforcing your mission statement and putting it in everything you do. It tells your audience what your company stands for, as well as its values, which people want to know when they invest in a new brand. - Jared Atchison[13], WPForms[14]8. Overcome Past PerceptionsOne of the most universal sticking points of rebranding is overcoming an old reputation. Old customers will have a harder time moving past their perceptions of the original brand. Unless you're trying to completely erase your old brand, you will want to carry some elements through to the rebrand. For example, you could keep some of your basic colors or design patterns to help ease the transition. - Shu Saito[15], Fact Retriever[16]9. Watch Out for Trademark IssuesWhen you're rebranding, it's important to keep in mind awareness of, and adherence to, trademark law. Remember to check if your new business name is being used on the market, or if your new brand resembles any other brand on the market. You want to avoid similarity with any other brand as much as possible, lest you fall in hot water with the law. - Frederik Bussler[17], bitgrit Inc.[18]10. Consider Making Changes GraduallyRebranding usually takes a lot more time and effort than you plan for. As with any big project, there will likely be unforeseen issues and costs that arise. These might be related to marketing, customer retention or SEO. Implementing small changes gradually to bring you closer in line with your target audience may be a better option for some businesses, as opposed to investing in a complete rebrand. - Reuben Yonatan[19], GetVoIP[20] [ 1]: https://yec.co/ [ 2]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/Stoneage [ 3]:       \xc2\xa0    http://phenomenon.com/ [ 4]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/benjaminkwalker [ 5]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/medicare_finder [ 6]:       \xc2\xa0    http://www.medicareplanfinder.com/ [ 7]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/johnturner [ 8]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.seedprod.com/ [ 9]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/thestephwells [ 10]:       \xc2\xa0    https://formidableforms.com/ [ 11]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/designlico [ 12]:       \xc2\xa0    https://designli.co/ [ 13]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/jaredatch [ 14]:       \xc2\xa0    https://wpforms.com/ [ 15]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/factretriever [ 16]:       \xc2\xa0    https://www.factretriever.com/ [ 17]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/bitgrit_global [ 18]:       \xc2\xa0    http://bitgrit.net/ [ 19]:       \xc2\xa0    https://twitter.com/reubenyonatan [ 20]:       \xc2\xa0    https://getvoip.com/ \n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0August 9, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",10 Things to Remember When Planning to Rebrand,https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5WSD-P091-F03R-N18R-00000-00&context=1516831,2019-08-09,1.0

The new Ardent Animal Health will build on its base of innovative therapies for osteoarthritis and cancer. As the first company worldwide providing point-of-care regenerative cell therapy within veterinary clinics, Ardent Animal Health looks to accelerate growth and development of its pipeline.\n\nMediVet Biologics is announcing a new name and a new look for its corporate brand as it relaunches itself as Ardent Animal Health.\n\nIn the years since its inception in 2016, the new Ardent Animal Health has developed into a global leader in the areas of veterinary regenerative medicine and oncology solutions for animals. The company\'s core mission is to develop affordable, innovative treatments for animal cancer and disease while supporting its veterinary partners in their efforts to make a positive impact on pet health.\n\n""The name \'Ardent\' captures the spirit of our organization as a company with fiery passion for innovation guided by compassion for the well-being of animals. The new brand translates the enormous and unique impact our veterinarian customers make each day in the lives of their patients. Our aim is to leverage our brand to accelerate connecting pet owners seeking advanced care to our expanding network of progressive veterinarian partners around the world,"" says Thomas Masterson, President of Ardent Animal Health.\n\nUnder its former brand of MediVet Biologics, Ardent Animal Health developed the first in-clinic adipose regenerative stem cell therapy kit, ActiStem Therapy. A major scientific advancement in animal regenerative medicine, the product offers an economic solution for owners of pets suffering from osteoarthritis, hip dysplasia, and ligament and cartilage injuries, as well as numerous mobility ailments. In addition to regenerative cells from fat, Ardent-certified hospitals offer other biologic treatments such as Platelet Rich Plasma, or PRP, a blood-derived treatment gaining popularity in human sports medicine.\n\nArdent Animal Health is unique for a company of its size, as it has surrounded its current and pipeline products with strong intellectual property and multiple collaborative university studies. This has allowed the company to grow, cementing its current technology, and look toward the future for its stem cell-based product pipeline candidates. Ardent Animal Health will launch with an extensive following of pet owners and veterinarians positively impacted by its products and services. The studies, passionate customers, and patient outcomes continue to provide momentum for the company\'s technology and products. Over 20,000 veterinary patients have received treatment of an Ardent Animal Health regenerative product or service.\n\nArdent Animal Health has also introduced cutting edge science to fight against canine cancer with its cancer vaccine service, K9- ACV, an immunotherapy vaccine generated from a canine patient\'s own cancerous tumor. K9-ACV is designed to stimulate the canine patient\'s immune response to attack the cancer. ""We are looking to meet an unmet need in pet cancer, at the family veterinarian office when needed. 50% of dogs over the age of ten will develop some type of cancer, so there is a need for a broadly applicable approach that can improve lifespan at a reasonable cost. Our preliminary studies and extensive market research indicate this approach will provide access to pets that need it,"" Masterson said.\n\nAccording to Mr. Masterson, the company\'s strength in these core innovative therapeutic areas will allow the organization to accelerate growth following its recent transition in both leadership and ownership. As a portfolio company of STUCK Fund 1, based in Milwaukee, WI, Ardent Animal Health will continue to develop novel approaches for early disease detection and treatments, with a focus on precision medicine for pets in need.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\n""We will continue to focus much of our strategy in creating novel products and services utilized in veterinary hospitals. We believe that this approach is key to the future of animal health. It is important not only for value creation but to ensure veterinarians have the ability to diagnose and treat their patients with the same leading-edge strategies underway in human health. Our animal family members deserve it.""\n\nDisclaimer\n\nExperimental Cancer Vaccines created by Ardent Animal Health are provided under 9 CFR 103.3 via USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics oversight for use under supervision/prescription of a licensed veterinarian.

Of course, your brand is much more than your logo, and we've written about this before[1]. However, when you ask someone about a brand, the logo is generally the first thing that pops into their mind. This is where your brand lives after all: In the mind of your customer. Your logo isn't the only thing your customer thinks about when your brand your brand pops into their head \xe2\x80\x94 customer service, news and events, recent articles, the emotions they feel when your brand is mentioned, the attitudes they have towards your brand, your products and services (especially if they really like or really hate them). But through all of that, visually, your logo takes precedence. \n\nIt's the touchstone, and it's important. So it's obviously critical that your logo be awesome, simple, memorable, adaptable, and clearly relevant to what you do. If your current logo doesn't fit these criteria, it may be time to consider a logo redesign. But how do you know when you should update your logo? Redesigning or altering your logo, or even coming up with a brand new logo, is expensive and time-consuming. It's also possibly a huge undertaking, depending on how large your company is and how many different pieces of marketing collateral you have, both online and offline, not to mention any branded materials you might have generally, from letterhead to a fleet of trucks. If you've only got a handful of business cards and a website, it's not that big of a deal. If you've got your logo plastered across 300 employee uniforms, a fleet of trucks, thousands of business cards, a website, hundreds of brochures, well You get the idea \xe2\x80\x94 it's going to be a lot tougher, a lot more expensive, and something you're really going to want to think about.Let Us Start With the Basics Before We Jump Into Logo Redesign. What Is a Logo?Here's a simple definition: 'A graphic representation or symbol of a company name, trademark, abbreviation, etc., often uniquely designed for ready recognition,' (dictionary.com[2]). Logos have many goals, but the main one is to represent your company well. If your logo is not aesthetically pleasing, or worse, doesn't clearly communicate what your business does, it may be time to consider a logo redesign. With that in mind, keeping your logo up to date with contemporary design trends and ideas can be important for businesses over time. Many businesses update their logo every few decades to avoid being seen as old or behind the times. Coke and Pepsi are prime examples of this, both undergoing multiple rebranding campaigns over the decades. If your logo isn't resonating with your target audience, it may be time for a logo redesign, but there are other scenarios where a redesign may be appropriate. Here are 3 scenarios where you might consider a logo redesign.1. Your Business Has ChangedIf your business is experiencing a merger or a name change, then it may be the perfect time to redesign your logo. Other business changes may warrant a logo redesign, like adding new products or services. You may even be taking your business in a completely different direction, for example, reducing your B2C services and increasing your B2B services.2. You're Ready to Update Your Brand's LookNow, a dated look isn't necessarily a bad thing, and a rebrand is kind of a big deal (not to mention expensive and time-consuming), so you don't want to go into this just because you feel like the logo is a little dated. Make sure there's a discernible benefit to updating the logo. For instance, if your customer base has grown younger over the years and they often comment on the dated look of the logo, it may make sense to update for the changed customer base. Standards of design are changing all the time and your businesses' branding may have to change to reflect that, but keep this in mind \xe2\x80\x94 the best logos are timeless. Don't get carried away by design trends that disappear in a few years. For instance, Apple has consistently updated their logo and striven for progressively simpler design. However, they're not doing it often \xe2\x80\x94 just when the time is right. Their brand relies on being seen as forward thinking, cutting edge, innovative, and always in front of new designs. As part of their brand, they have to update regularly. 3. You Chose Your Original Logo Quickly and Now You're Ready Make It ProfessionalSo this is sort of an amalgam of the first two, but it's a unique enough and common enough situation that it bears its own section. It's not uncommon for businesses to start without any sort of branding plan, especially businesses that grow organically and were never intended to be more than some freelance work or side work. For businesses that started in this way, the logo may have been put together quickly and easily with little thought and no budget because something is better than nothing. Now that your business has grown, you've decided to throw out the stop-gap solution and get something more permanent. It's clear that this is a full-fledged business and that you're going to keep moving forward with how things are growing, so you've decided to invest in your branding. The logo is the natural place to start.You've Decided to Invest in a Logo Redesign \xe2\x80\x94 Now What?Redesigning your logo is much more art than science. We can give you some general suggestions, but honestly, this is something you have to feel out. Where you go with the redesign is completely up to you. A drastic change may make sense if you're moving the business in a very different direction or merging two well-known companies with a lot of baggage. However, a slight upgrade may be exactly what you want (and avoid alienating your audience). It's something you want to give careful consideration, to plan out effectively, and to only do with adult marketing supervision. If you don't have an experienced designer and an experienced rebranding expert on board, you're gonna have a bad time. So, do you think your logo is in need of a refresh?

It described tronc as ""a content curation and monetization company focused on creating and distributing premium, verified content across all channels."" The name change is slated to go into effect June 20. Alongside the rebranding, the company is transferring its stock exchange listing from the New York Stock Exchange to the Nasdaq Global Select Market, with common shares expected to begin trading June 20 under the ticker TRNC.\n\nMeanwhile, with the final shareholder vote tally yet to be released pending review by an inspector, Gannett said it was still weighing whether to continue its attempt to take over the company. Gannett had urged Tribune shareholders to withhold votes from the company\'s director nominees as a way to pressure Tribune to engage in deal negotiations.\n\nIn a June 2 statement, Gannett indicated that it believed the shareholder vote was nearly evenly split for the entire director slate and that 58% of shareholders withheld support from two nominees, David Dibble and Philip Franklin. Tribune disputed this, saying Gannett had ""no reliable basis"" for its claims.\n\nTribune management earlier rejected two acquisition offers from Gannett, saying the unsolicited bids undervalued Tribune\'s long-term potential. Gannett in May offered to buy Tribune for $15 per share, up from a previous offer of $12.25 per share made public in April.\n\nIn a May 23 letter rejecting the second offer, Tribune announced a deal with Nant Capital LLC, which gives the investor a roughly 12.9% stake in the company for a growth capital investment of $70.5 million, making it Tribune\'s second-largest investor. The board had earlier adopted a poison pill shareholder rights plan to deter any group or shareholder from acquiring 20% or more of Tribune\'s shares. Nant Capital founder Patrick Soon-Shiong joined the Tribune board as vice chairman on June 2, as expected.\n\n""We thank Tribune Publishing shareholders for their support as we continue to execute our strategic transformation and reposition the company for long-term growth,"" Chairman Michael Ferro Jr. said in a June 2 statement following the shareholder vote. ""We have a tremendous opportunity at Tribune as we move aggressively to implement the changes necessary to succeed in the current environment and today\'s results demonstrate that the majority of our voting shareholders agree.""\n\nGannett\'s acquisition offers drew interest from activist investors including Oaktree Capital Management LP, which urged Tribune to consider a sale. However, several proxy advisory firms recommended shareholders reject Gannett\'s efforts to withhold support from Tribune\'s board. Following the June 2 shareholder vote, a spokesperson for Oaktree Capital said the company had no comment on the matter.\n\nAdding more fuel to the fire, Capital Structures Realty Advisors reportedly filed a lawsuit against Tribune\'s board, claiming it failed to maximize shareholders\' value by not taking Gannett\'s revised bid.\n\nThe hostility between the two media companies has led to a public back and forth between executives. At one point, Tribune Publishing Chairman Michael Ferro Jr. reportedly told some staffers at the Tribune-owned Los Angeles Times that he was preparing a bid for Gannett.\n\nAfter Gannett emerged from a spinoff transaction in 2015, the company\'s executives made clear plans to expand its network of national newspapers and rebrand under the USA Today name. Gannett had just completed its $280 million acquisition of Journal Media Group Inc. when it made public the offer for Tribune.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newsletter\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0SHAREHOLDERS (92%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); SHAREHOLDER MEETINGS (90%); TAKEOVERS (89%); BOARD CHANGES (89%); SHAREHOLDER PROXIES (78%); SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS (78%); COMPANY NAME CHANGES (78%); NEWS BRIEFS (54%); Print, Outdoor & Out of Home (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 TRIBUNE PUBLISHING CO (96%);  GANNETT CO INC (92%);  OAKTREE CAPITAL GROUP LLC (60%);  NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC (56%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0TPUB (NYSE) (96%); CGI (NYSE) (92%); OAK (NYSE) (60%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0PUBLISHING (78%); COMMON STOCK (78%); STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS (60%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0PATRICK SOON-SHIONG (76%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0June 13, 2016\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'","Tribune Publishing to rebrand; shareholders approve directors, future of Gannett bid unclear",https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=7655da83-8054-48d3-b8a2-cc199aeaf4d5&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5JYD-8DM1-JDVW-N0VJ-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=360279&pdteaserkey=sr97&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr97&prid=a100e925-071c-49f2-bec7-6685adcc0297,2016-06-03,1.0

[Original Research]\n\nConversionXL\n\nSeptember 29, 2016 Thursday 5:00 PM EST\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa02145 words\n\nByline:\xc2\xa0Jean Templin\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 29, 2016( ConversionXL: http://conversionxl.com/blog Delivered by Newstex)  What's the value in a logo? It's a question that's been asked a lot lately, especially with companies like Instagram, Uber, and Google drawing both ire and admiration from their new logo changes. We all have an opinion (some have strong opinions) on these changes, but no one really measures their effectiveness - which is what matters really. How do we answer the question: is your logo actually working?\n\nSome articles try to address the why behind the logo change, but no one talks about if the changes are working. We sought a more objective answer. Since we have the power of a visual engagement platform, we were able to break down the differences in brand recognition and recall, and see how logo changes affected perceptions. Regardless of how you feel about your favorite company's logo change, this article will breakdown original research on how the brands you know and trust are really performing. We conducted two experiments, which we'll refer to as (1) Logos Mixed in a Crowd and (2) Side by Side.Experiment 1: Logos Mixed in a CrowdFirst, we wanted to measure attention - essentially, which logos stand out from the crowd? So we placed ten recently-changed company logos in a grid (position randomized for each respondent to avoid placement bias[1]). The companies we analyzed were as follows: Twitter Foursquare Airbnb Uber Instagram Coors Light Paypal Google Facebook Yahoo! Here are the old logos: http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo1-1.jpg And the updated logos:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo2-1.jpgMethodologyWe started by showing one group of 100 people the new logotypes intermixed randomly and another group of 100 people the old logotypes. The logotypes were shown for ten seconds in a grid where the order of them was randomized (shown differently to each respondent) to avoid placement bias. By tracking people's gaze paths we can determine what they look at, in what order and for how long. That tells us what catches the most attention, and then we can calculate the average 'branding seconds' for each logotype. Branding Seconds is defined as the percentage of people who see the logotype multiplied with the average time they spend on it. This is a compound metric that shows how much attention the logo earns which is a predictor of likability. In previous\xc2\xa0Sticky study, we found that increasing[2] branding seconds 4x leads to a 1.7x increase in likability. Participants were then asked to list from memory the companies that they remembered, which tests brand recall.\xc2\xa0Participants were shown either the new logos or the old logos, but not both. The grid displayed for ten seconds to all participants. There are limitations to this methodology, as will be discussed below[3].ResultsYou can see all of the results from the 'grid experiment' here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo3-branding-seconds.png All new logotypes got more branding seconds than the old ones.The Biggest Winners of the StudyPayPal's new logo garnered 0.35 more branding seconds than its old logo, a 58% increase, and it also received the most overall attention at 0.91 branding seconds. Paypal ranked #1 both in amount improved and total branding seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paypal.png Uber ranked second in both total branding seconds and amount improved from its old logo, with an improvement of 54% from 0.61 to 0.94 seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-1.jpg While Google ranked seventh in total branding seconds with its new logo, it ranked third in amount improved. Its branding seconds increased 43%, increasing from 0.5 seconds with its old logo to 0.72 seconds with its new one.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google.jpg Foursquare's new logo clocked in at\xc2\xa00.86 seconds, up from 0.69 with a 26% gain.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/f.png Coors Light won big, as well, with 0.85 branding seconds at a 33% improvement from 0.64 to land in fourth place in both.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cl.png Twitter deserves a mention, too, tying Coors Light at 0.85 branding seconds, and improving by 21% against its old logo.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit.pngExperiment 2: Old vs. New Side by SideIn the second experiment, 100 people were shown the old and new logos side by side. The left/right positions were randomized to avoid placement bias and the logotypes were displayed for 5 seconds. This was to test whether the new or old logos garner more attention, which we can measure by tracking people's gaze paths. Let's see how each logo did Airbnb       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/airbnb-vs-air.png Side by side, the new Airbnb logo earned more attention than the old one. Coors Light       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/coors-vs-coors.png The old Coors Light logotype, with a focus on the bold typeface, got 0.7 more branding seconds. Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fb-vs-fb.png Facebook's new logo is a slight improvement on the old one, beating it by 0.2 seconds. Foursquare       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fs-vs-fs.png Foursquare's new logo received quite a bit less attention than the old one. Google       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/g-v-g.png Google's old logo earned more attention than the new one when placed side by side. Instagram       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ig-ig.png Looks like the haters were right: Instagram's old logo won by a decent amount, receiving .5 more branding seconds. The focus landed primarily on the text in the upper left-hand corner. PayPal       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pp-pp.png PayPal's updated logo is very slightly less attention gathering than the old one. Twitter       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit-vs-twit.png Twitter's new logo is a grand improvement with 133% more branding seconds compared to its old one. Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-vs-ube.png Uber's new logo had the same improvement as Twitter's new logo - a 133% increase in branding seconds. By the way, Uber's logo change - one of the most radical - received quite a bit of hate when it debuted. Yahoo!       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yahooooo.png Yahoo's new logo performed quite a bit worse. See all of the results here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/branding-seconds-2.pngTakeaways: What Matters?Some logos garnered more attention in the mixed crowd compared to the side by side test, like Coors Light, Paypal, Foursquare, and Google. But what does this actually mean? What does it mean that Twitter and Uber's new logos beat their old ones in terms of branding seconds and attracting attention from the crowd? What it comes down to is recall - will people remember seeing the logo, and upon remembering the logo, will they know the company? While brand recall from logotypes is just one aspect of a brand's image, analyzing brand recall is a useful metric because even if people spend hours looking at your logo, it doesn't mean anything unless they remember seeing it and remember which company it belongs to. In order to test brand recall, we asked the participants of the grid experiments to list which brands they remember seeing without any assistance. Again, participants were only shown either the old or the new logos in a grid, but not both. The results of the recall tests are below:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-one.png       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-two.png While, on average, the new logos were less able to be recalled than the old logos, some did better than others. Facebook, Google, and Twitter were\xc2\xa0the big winners in the recall test with unaided recall percentages above 15% for each of them. However, Facebook did the best because its recall percentage actually increased, from 20% to 21%. Google's went down, but only slightly, from 24% to 19%, and Twitter's actually decreased the most, from 51% to 24%. Twitter had the most room to spare though, with a 27% lead on its nearest competitor to the old logo, and it maintained its top spot. Coors Light deserves an honorable mention for keeping its recall percentage consistent at 11%. The biggest loser was Uber, with the lowest recall percentage at 2%, dropping from 14% for its old logo. Airbnb, Foursquare, and Instagram were\xc2\xa0all close behind at 4% recall. Paypal also deserves an honorable mention for dropping from 23% to 8%.Overall Biggest Winner and LoserBiggest Winner: Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-winner.png Even though Twitter had slightly better brand recall, Facebook's was the only one to improve with the new logo (Twitter's decreased by about half even though it kept the top spot). Facebook also experienced an 8% increase in branding seconds in the side by side test and an 18% improvement in the grid test. Biggest Loser: Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-loser-1.jpg Uber made great strides in both the grid test (increasing brand seconds by more than 50%) and the side-by-side test (increasing branding seconds more than 30%), but these improvements don't matter unless people recognize it as Uber's logo. Because Uber had the absolute lowest brand recall score at 2%, we know that they don't recognize the new logo as Uber's, so all the branding seconds Uber's been racking up are essentially useless. However, there is hope: As people use the app more and grow accustomed to the icon, they will surely begin to recognize it as Uber's. It would be interesting to run the test again in a few months to see if Uber's brand recall score improves.LimitationsThese experiments come with certain limitations, which we want to disclose upfront: In our set-up and analysis, we don't account for the brands strength (e.g. it's easier for most to remember Facebook than Uber). We didn't test the logos in a real life context. It's a 'competition' with other logos and they might work differently on say an ad or on a web page. We only tested two different versions of the logos. That makes it harder to understand what draws and holds attention compared to if we could test several radically different iterations of the logos. We tested the old logos side by side the new logos, which is a situation that hardly ever appears in the course of normal, daily life. Once a company changes their logo, they won't leave the old logos up as a comparison point. Because some of the companies had very similar results, it's hard to draw conclusions because the differences are within the margin of error, e.g. the difference between 2-4 or 45-50. Therefore, the results are indicative of a pattern but not hard and fast proof of any objective truth. It's a good starting point, but more studies should be done.ConclusionIn summary, companies that are looking to change their image shouldn't be afraid to start with their logo - every new logo did better in the crowd experiment compared to the old logos. However, there are a few things to keep in mind Initial brand recognition is important. Before any big logo change, it's necessary that people can recognize the old logo in order that the new logo holds any sort of sway or brand recall with the initial customer base. And, related to that point, in general it's best to keep logo changes grounded in the old logo. When changing the logo drastically, e.g. Uber, brand recall falls tremendously. If the new logo bears a basic resemblance to the old logo, people will still recognize the brand, as in the case of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Coors. Logo changes can be a great way to communicate internal change to the general public. If a company's culture, value or internal structure changes, it might be a good idea to change the logo as well.

The company expects the rebranding to happen over the next few weeks as it updates its mobile wallet application.\n\nhttp://www.fiercewireless.com/story/isis-mobile-payments-company-rebrands-itself-softcard/2014-09-03\n\n  Isis has rebranded to Softcard.\n\nThe mobile payments group announced in July it would change its name. Since then, ISIS has continued to conduct violent attacks in Iraq and Syria, and gained widespread attention by releasing videotaped beheadings of two American journalists held by the group as captives, James Foley and more recently Steven Sotloff.\n\n""Our search for a new name has been rooted in our founding vision: to use the power of the mobile phone to help consumers find a safer and better way to shop, pay and save,"" Softcard CEO Michael Abbott wrote in a company blog post. ""But we also wanted a name and visual identity that had the power, flexibility and simplicity to define our category.""\n\nAbbott added that the company has ""no desire to share a name with this group [ISIS] and our hearts go out to those affected by this violence.""\n\n""Together with a simple and flexible visual system, the inherent simplicity of Softcard gives it the potential to become a category defining name,"" Abbott wrote. ""That\'s a bold aspiration, but one that matches the breadth of our vision.""\n\nSoftcard is backed by Verizon Wireless (NYSE: VZ), AT&T Mobility (      \xc2\xa0    NYSE:T) and T-Mobile US (      \xc2\xa0    NYSE:TMUS), and was founded in November 2010. The company officially launched nationwide in November 2013.\n\nAbbott wrote that users\' current Isis Wallet will continue to work as it always has and that in the next few weeks the company will launch the updated Softcard app. At that point, users can update their apps as they normally would and see the change. ""We appreciate your patience as we work through this effort,"" he added. ""Because we\'ve chosen to move swiftly, small traces of Isis will be visible for a short time.""\n\nAbbott did not give any updates on the state of the company\'s mobile payments and commerce business. On May 14, the company said that on average it had activated more than 20,000 mobile wallets per day in the preceding 30 days, giving it at least 600,000 members during that period. Since then the company has been silent on its operational progress.\n\nThe mobile payments market is expected to get a jolt next week. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has reportedly reached deals with Visa, MasterCard and American Express for its mobile payments program it is expected unveil alongside the next iPhone on Sept. 9.\n\nLast week, reports emerged that the next iPhone, expected to be dubbed the iPhone 6, will contain support for Near Field Communications technology for mobile payments for the first time. According to a Financial Times report, Apple is working with Dutch chipset specialist NXP Semiconductors on the NFC solution. Apple also reportedly wants to launch a mobile wallet without giving up any control to wireless carriers, which would represent a blow to Softcard\'s business model.\n\nFor more:\n\n  - see this Isis blog post\n\n  \n\n  Related Articles: \n\n      \xc2\xa0    Report: Apple snags mobile payments agreements with Visa, MasterCard and American Express\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Apple will reportedly include NFC, powered by NXP, for mobile payments in iPhone 6\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Report: Apple could sidestep Isis with launch of mobile wallet with iPhone 6 this fall\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Isis mobile payments venture to rebrand because of ISIS militant group\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Isis activated at least 600,000 mobile wallets in the past month\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Google acknowledges slow Wallet adoption, but promises to stick with it\n\n      \xc2\xa0    Isis progress: 2/3 of users have inputted card info, make 6-7 transactions per month\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0ISLAMIC STATE IN IRAQ & THE LEVANT (91%); MOBILE PAYMENTS (90%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (90%); FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); MOBILE COMMERCE (89%); CONSUMERS (78%); COMPANY NAME CHANGES (78%); ELECTRONIC WALLETS (73%); RELIGION (73%); WRITERS (70%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (68%); Apple (%); Isis (%); Michael Abbott (%); mobile payments (%); Service Provider Strategies (%); Softcard (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 AT&T MOBILITY LLC (90%);  AT&T INC (90%);  VERIZON WIRELESS INC (83%);  VISA INC (60%);  VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC (56%);  T-MOBILE US INC (53%);  T-MOBILE USA INC (53%);  AMERICAN EXPRESS CO (50%);  APPLE INC (50%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0T (NYSE) (90%); V (NYSE) (60%); VZC (LSE) (56%); VZ (NYSE) (56%); TMUS (NYSE) (53%); AXP (NYSE) (50%); AAPL (NASDAQ) (50%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0MOBILE PAYMENTS (90%); FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (90%); CREDIT CARDS (89%); SMARTPHONES (89%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (89%); MOBILE COMMERCE (89%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (78%); NEAR FIELD COMMUNICATIONS (73%); ELECTRONIC WALLETS (73%); WRITERS (70%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (68%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED STATES (91%); IRAQ (90%); SYRIA (73%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 5, 2014\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Isis mobile payments company rebrands itself as Softcard,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=451909c6-20d4-4759-8f05-8e6bfb6ee964&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5D2P-ST91-JB6S-F4G8-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=414601&pdteaserkey=sr134&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr134&prid=203f4a61-be6f-402d-af70-7e1b4fcb92c0,2014-09-03,1.0

It's a question that's been asked a lot lately, especially with companies like Instagram, Uber, and Google drawing both ire and admiration from their new logo changes. We all have an opinion (some have strong opinions) on these changes, but no one really measures their effectiveness - which is what matters really. How do we answer the question: is your logo actually working?\n\n Some articles try to address the why behind the logo change, but no one talks about if the changes are working. We sought a more objective answer. Since we have the power of a visual engagement platform, we were able to break down the differences in brand recognition and recall, and see how logo changes affected perceptions. Regardless of how you feel about your favorite company's logo change, this article will breakdown original research on how the brands you know and trust are really performing. We conducted two experiments, which we'll refer to as (1) Logos Mixed in a Crowd and (2) Side by Side.Experiment 1: Logos Mixed in a CrowdFirst, we wanted to measure attention - essentially, which logos stand out from the crowd? So we placed ten recently-changed company logos in a grid (position randomized for each respondent to avoid placement bias[1]). The companies we analyzed were as follows: Twitter Foursquare Airbnb Uber Instagram Coors Light Paypal Google Facebook Yahoo! Here are the old logos: http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo1-1.jpg And the updated logos:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo2-1.jpgMethodologyWe started by showing one group of 100 people the new logotypes intermixed randomly and another group of 100 people the old logotypes. The logotypes were shown for ten seconds in a grid where the order of them was randomized (shown differently to each respondent) to avoid placement bias. By tracking people's gaze paths we can determine what they look at, in what order and for how long. That tells us what catches the most attention, and then we can calculate the average 'branding seconds' for each logotype. Branding Seconds is defined as the percentage of people who see the logotype multiplied with the average time they spend on it. This is a compound metric that shows how much attention the logo earns which is a predictor of likability. In previous Sticky study, we found that increasing[2] branding seconds 4x leads to a 1.7x increase in likability. Participants were then asked to list from memory the companies that they remembered, which tests brand recall. Participants were shown either the new logos or the old logos, but not both. The grid displayed for ten seconds to all participants. There are limitations to this methodology, as will be discussed below[3].ResultsYou can see all of the results from the 'grid experiment' here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo3-branding-seconds.png All new logotypes got more branding seconds than the old ones.The Biggest Winners of the StudyPayPal's new logo garnered 0.35 more branding seconds than its old logo, a 58% increase, and it also received the most overall attention at 0.91 branding seconds. Paypal ranked #1 both in amount improved and total branding seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paypal.png Uber ranked second in both total branding seconds and amount improved from its old logo, with an improvement of 54% from 0.61 to 0.94 seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-1.jpg While Google ranked seventh in total branding seconds with its new logo, it ranked third in amount improved. Its branding seconds increased 43%, increasing from 0.5 seconds with its old logo to 0.72 seconds with its new one.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google.jpg Foursquare's new logo clocked in at 0.86 seconds, up from 0.69 with a 26% gain.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/f.png Coors Light won big, as well, with 0.85 branding seconds at a 33% improvement from 0.64 to land in fourth place in both.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cl.png Twitter deserves a mention, too, tying Coors Light at 0.85 branding seconds, and improving by 21% against its old logo.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit.pngExperiment 2: Old vs. New Side by SideIn the second experiment, 100 people were shown the old and new logos side by side. The left/right positions were randomized to avoid placement bias and the logotypes were displayed for 5 seconds. This was to test whether the new or old logos garner more attention, which we can measure by tracking people's gaze paths. Let's see how each logo did Airbnb       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/airbnb-vs-air.png Side by side, the new Airbnb logo earned more attention than the old one. Coors Light       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/coors-vs-coors.png The old Coors Light logotype, with a focus on the bold typeface, got 0.7 more branding seconds. Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fb-vs-fb.png Facebook's new logo is a slight improvement on the old one, beating it by 0.2 seconds. Foursquare       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fs-vs-fs.png Foursquare's new logo received quite a bit less attention than the old one. Google       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/g-v-g.png Google's old logo earned more attention than the new one when placed side by side. Instagram       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ig-ig.png Looks like the haters were right: Instagram's old logo won by a decent amount, receiving .5 more branding seconds. The focus landed primarily on the text in the upper left-hand corner. PayPal       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pp-pp.png PayPal's updated logo is very slightly less attention gathering than the old one. Twitter       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit-vs-twit.png Twitter's new logo is a grand improvement with 133% more branding seconds compared to its old one. Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-vs-ube.png Uber's new logo had the same improvement as Twitter's new logo - a 133% increase in branding seconds. By the way, Uber's logo change - one of the most radical - received quite a bit of hate when it debuted. Yahoo!       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yahooooo.png Yahoo's new logo performed quite a bit worse. See all of the results here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/branding-seconds-2.pngTakeaways: What Matters?Some logos garnered more attention in the mixed crowd compared to the side by side test, like Coors Light, Paypal, Foursquare, and Google. But what does this actually mean? What does it mean that Twitter and Uber's new logos beat their old ones in terms of branding seconds and attracting attention from the crowd? What it comes down to is recall - will people remember seeing the logo, and upon remembering the logo, will they know the company? While brand recall from logotypes is just one aspect of a brand's image, analyzing brand recall is a useful metric because even if people spend hours looking at your logo, it doesn't mean anything unless they remember seeing it and remember which company it belongs to. In order to test brand recall, we asked the participants of the grid experiments to list which brands they remember seeing without any assistance. Again, participants were only shown either the old or the new logos in a grid, but not both. The results of the recall tests are below:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-one.png       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-two.png While, on average, the new logos were less able to be recalled than the old logos, some did better than others. Facebook, Google, and Twitter were the big winners in the recall test with unaided recall percentages above 15% for each of them. However, Facebook did the best because its recall percentage actually increased, from 20% to 21%. Google's went down, but only slightly, from 24% to 19%, and Twitter's actually decreased the most, from 51% to 24%. Twitter had the most room to spare though, with a 27% lead on its nearest competitor to the old logo, and it maintained its top spot. Coors Light deserves an honorable mention for keeping its recall percentage consistent at 11%. The biggest loser was Uber, with the lowest recall percentage at 2%, dropping from 14% for its old logo. Airbnb, Foursquare, and Instagram were all close behind at 4% recall. Paypal also deserves an honorable mention for dropping from 23% to 8%.Overall Biggest Winner and LoserBiggest Winner: Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-winner.png Even though Twitter had slightly better brand recall, Facebook's was the only one to improve with the new logo (Twitter's decreased by about half even though it kept the top spot). Facebook also experienced an 8% increase in branding seconds in the side by side test and an 18% improvement in the grid test. Biggest Loser: Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-loser-1.jpg Uber made great strides in both the grid test (increasing brand seconds by more than 50%) and the side-by-side test (increasing branding seconds more than 30%), but these improvements don't matter unless people recognize it as Uber's logo. Because Uber had the absolute lowest brand recall score at 2%, we know that they don't recognize the new logo as Uber's, so all the branding seconds Uber's been racking up are essentially useless. However, there is hope: As people use the app more and grow accustomed to the icon, they will surely begin to recognize it as Uber's. It would be interesting to run the test again in a few months to see if Uber's brand recall score improves.LimitationsThese experiments come with certain limitations, which we want to disclose upfront: In our set-up and analysis, we don't account for the brands strength (e.g. it's easier for most to remember Facebook than Uber). We didn't test the logos in a real life context. It's a 'competition' with other logos and they might work differently on say an ad or on a web page. We only tested two different versions of the logos. That makes it harder to understand what draws and holds attention compared to if we could test several radically different iterations of the logos. We tested the old logos side by side the new logos, which is a situation that hardly ever appears in the course of normal, daily life. Once a company changes their logo, they won't leave the old logos up as a comparison point. Because some of the companies had very similar results, it's hard to draw conclusions because the differences are within the margin of error, e.g. the difference between 2-4 or 45-50. Therefore, the results are indicative of a pattern but not hard and fast proof of any objective truth. It's a good starting point, but more studies should be done.ConclusionIn summary, companies that are looking to change their image shouldn't be afraid to start with their logo - every new logo did better in the crowd experiment compared to the old logos. However, there are a few things to keep in mind Initial brand recognition is important. Before any big logo change, it's necessary that people can recognize the old logo in order that the new logo holds any sort of sway or brand recall with the initial customer base. And, related to that point, in general it's best to keep logo changes grounded in the old logo. When changing the logo drastically, e.g. Uber, brand recall falls tremendously. If the new logo bears a basic resemblance to the old logo, people will still recognize the brand, as in the case of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Coors. Logo changes can be a great way to communicate internal change to the general public. If a company's culture, value or internal structure changes, it might be a good idea to change the logo as well.

[Original Research]\n\nConversionXL\n\nSeptember 29, 2016 Thursday 5:00 PM EST\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa02145 words\n\nByline:\xc2\xa0Jean Templin\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 29, 2016( ConversionXL: http://conversionxl.com/blog Delivered by Newstex)  What's the value in a logo? It's a question that's been asked a lot lately, especially with companies like Instagram, Uber, and Google drawing both ire and admiration from their new logo changes. We all have an opinion (some have strong opinions) on these changes, but no one really measures their effectiveness - which is what matters really. How do we answer the question: is your logo actually working?\n\nSome articles try to address the why behind the logo change, but no one talks about if the changes are working. We sought a more objective answer. Since we have the power of a visual engagement platform, we were able to break down the differences in brand recognition and recall, and see how logo changes affected perceptions. Regardless of how you feel about your favorite company's logo change, this article will breakdown original research on how the brands you know and trust are really performing. We conducted two experiments, which we'll refer to as (1) Logos Mixed in a Crowd and (2) Side by Side.Experiment 1: Logos Mixed in a CrowdFirst, we wanted to measure attention - essentially, which logos stand out from the crowd? So we placed ten recently-changed company logos in a grid (position randomized for each respondent to avoid placement bias[1]). The companies we analyzed were as follows: Twitter Foursquare Airbnb Uber Instagram Coors Light Paypal Google Facebook Yahoo! Here are the old logos: http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo1-1.jpg And the updated logos:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo2-1.jpgMethodologyWe started by showing one group of 100 people the new logotypes intermixed randomly and another group of 100 people the old logotypes. The logotypes were shown for ten seconds in a grid where the order of them was randomized (shown differently to each respondent) to avoid placement bias. By tracking people's gaze paths we can determine what they look at, in what order and for how long. That tells us what catches the most attention, and then we can calculate the average 'branding seconds' for each logotype. Branding Seconds is defined as the percentage of people who see the logotype multiplied with the average time they spend on it. This is a compound metric that shows how much attention the logo earns which is a predictor of likability. In previous\xc2\xa0Sticky study, we found that increasing[2] branding seconds 4x leads to a 1.7x increase in likability. Participants were then asked to list from memory the companies that they remembered, which tests brand recall.\xc2\xa0Participants were shown either the new logos or the old logos, but not both. The grid displayed for ten seconds to all participants. There are limitations to this methodology, as will be discussed below[3].ResultsYou can see all of the results from the 'grid experiment' here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/logo3-branding-seconds.png All new logotypes got more branding seconds than the old ones.The Biggest Winners of the StudyPayPal's new logo garnered 0.35 more branding seconds than its old logo, a 58% increase, and it also received the most overall attention at 0.91 branding seconds. Paypal ranked #1 both in amount improved and total branding seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/paypal.png Uber ranked second in both total branding seconds and amount improved from its old logo, with an improvement of 54% from 0.61 to 0.94 seconds.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-1.jpg While Google ranked seventh in total branding seconds with its new logo, it ranked third in amount improved. Its branding seconds increased 43%, increasing from 0.5 seconds with its old logo to 0.72 seconds with its new one.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/google.jpg Foursquare's new logo clocked in at\xc2\xa00.86 seconds, up from 0.69 with a 26% gain.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/f.png Coors Light won big, as well, with 0.85 branding seconds at a 33% improvement from 0.64 to land in fourth place in both.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cl.png Twitter deserves a mention, too, tying Coors Light at 0.85 branding seconds, and improving by 21% against its old logo.       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit.pngExperiment 2: Old vs. New Side by SideIn the second experiment, 100 people were shown the old and new logos side by side. The left/right positions were randomized to avoid placement bias and the logotypes were displayed for 5 seconds. This was to test whether the new or old logos garner more attention, which we can measure by tracking people's gaze paths. Let's see how each logo did Airbnb       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/airbnb-vs-air.png Side by side, the new Airbnb logo earned more attention than the old one. Coors Light       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/coors-vs-coors.png The old Coors Light logotype, with a focus on the bold typeface, got 0.7 more branding seconds. Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fb-vs-fb.png Facebook's new logo is a slight improvement on the old one, beating it by 0.2 seconds. Foursquare       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fs-vs-fs.png Foursquare's new logo received quite a bit less attention than the old one. Google       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/g-v-g.png Google's old logo earned more attention than the new one when placed side by side. Instagram       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ig-ig.png Looks like the haters were right: Instagram's old logo won by a decent amount, receiving .5 more branding seconds. The focus landed primarily on the text in the upper left-hand corner. PayPal       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/pp-pp.png PayPal's updated logo is very slightly less attention gathering than the old one. Twitter       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/twit-vs-twit.png Twitter's new logo is a grand improvement with 133% more branding seconds compared to its old one. Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/ube-vs-ube.png Uber's new logo had the same improvement as Twitter's new logo - a 133% increase in branding seconds. By the way, Uber's logo change - one of the most radical - received quite a bit of hate when it debuted. Yahoo!       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/yahooooo.png Yahoo's new logo performed quite a bit worse. See all of the results here:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/branding-seconds-2.pngTakeaways: What Matters?Some logos garnered more attention in the mixed crowd compared to the side by side test, like Coors Light, Paypal, Foursquare, and Google. But what does this actually mean? What does it mean that Twitter and Uber's new logos beat their old ones in terms of branding seconds and attracting attention from the crowd? What it comes down to is recall - will people remember seeing the logo, and upon remembering the logo, will they know the company? While brand recall from logotypes is just one aspect of a brand's image, analyzing brand recall is a useful metric because even if people spend hours looking at your logo, it doesn't mean anything unless they remember seeing it and remember which company it belongs to. In order to test brand recall, we asked the participants of the grid experiments to list which brands they remember seeing without any assistance. Again, participants were only shown either the old or the new logos in a grid, but not both. The results of the recall tests are below:       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-one.png       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/table-two.png While, on average, the new logos were less able to be recalled than the old logos, some did better than others. Facebook, Google, and Twitter were\xc2\xa0the big winners in the recall test with unaided recall percentages above 15% for each of them. However, Facebook did the best because its recall percentage actually increased, from 20% to 21%. Google's went down, but only slightly, from 24% to 19%, and Twitter's actually decreased the most, from 51% to 24%. Twitter had the most room to spare though, with a 27% lead on its nearest competitor to the old logo, and it maintained its top spot. Coors Light deserves an honorable mention for keeping its recall percentage consistent at 11%. The biggest loser was Uber, with the lowest recall percentage at 2%, dropping from 14% for its old logo. Airbnb, Foursquare, and Instagram were\xc2\xa0all close behind at 4% recall. Paypal also deserves an honorable mention for dropping from 23% to 8%.Overall Biggest Winner and LoserBiggest Winner: Facebook       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-winner.png Even though Twitter had slightly better brand recall, Facebook's was the only one to improve with the new logo (Twitter's decreased by about half even though it kept the top spot). Facebook also experienced an 8% increase in branding seconds in the side by side test and an 18% improvement in the grid test. Biggest Loser: Uber       \xc2\xa0    http://conversionxl.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/biggest-loser-1.jpg Uber made great strides in both the grid test (increasing brand seconds by more than 50%) and the side-by-side test (increasing branding seconds more than 30%), but these improvements don't matter unless people recognize it as Uber's logo. Because Uber had the absolute lowest brand recall score at 2%, we know that they don't recognize the new logo as Uber's, so all the branding seconds Uber's been racking up are essentially useless. However, there is hope: As people use the app more and grow accustomed to the icon, they will surely begin to recognize it as Uber's. It would be interesting to run the test again in a few months to see if Uber's brand recall score improves.LimitationsThese experiments come with certain limitations, which we want to disclose upfront: In our set-up and analysis, we don't account for the brands strength (e.g. it's easier for most to remember Facebook than Uber). We didn't test the logos in a real life context. It's a 'competition' with other logos and they might work differently on say an ad or on a web page. We only tested two different versions of the logos. That makes it harder to understand what draws and holds attention compared to if we could test several radically different iterations of the logos. We tested the old logos side by side the new logos, which is a situation that hardly ever appears in the course of normal, daily life. Once a company changes their logo, they won't leave the old logos up as a comparison point. Because some of the companies had very similar results, it's hard to draw conclusions because the differences are within the margin of error, e.g. the difference between 2-4 or 45-50. Therefore, the results are indicative of a pattern but not hard and fast proof of any objective truth. It's a good starting point, but more studies should be done.ConclusionIn summary, companies that are looking to change their image shouldn't be afraid to start with their logo - every new logo did better in the crowd experiment compared to the old logos. However, there are a few things to keep in mind Initial brand recognition is important. Before any big logo change, it's necessary that people can recognize the old logo in order that the new logo holds any sort of sway or brand recall with the initial customer base. And, related to that point, in general it's best to keep logo changes grounded in the old logo. When changing the logo drastically, e.g. Uber, brand recall falls tremendously. If the new logo bears a basic resemblance to the old logo, people will still recognize the brand, as in the case of Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Coors. Logo changes can be a great way to communicate internal change to the general public. If a company's culture, value or internal structure changes, it might be a good idea to change the logo as well.

Two diamond holes are expected to be drilled before Christmas, with more planned from January 2020.\n\nBritish Lithium is the brainchild of Roderick and Andrew Smith, working with a team of highly experienced engineers, environmental consultants, academics and geologists.\n\nRoderick was CEO of a number of publicly listed mining companies in Australia for more than 25 years and is an acknowledged world expert in the production, supply and demand of speciality metals. A qualified chartered accountant, he has a post-graduate diploma in Mining Investment Analysis and is a Fellow of the Financial Services Institute.\n\nAndrew Smith has worked at a senior level in the mining industry for the last thirteen years and been responsible for four successful feasibility studies. He recently project-managed the Cinovec lithium tin project in the Czech Republic and, before that, ran a large international team for Comincos definitive feasibility study on the $600m phosphate mine in the Republic of Congo.\n\nThanks to the important role lithium plays in renewable battery technology, global demand currently far outstrips supply. The metal has never been extracted from the mica in granite before  making the work British Lithium is doing in Cornwall even more innovative.\n\nLaboratory analysis of our initial drilling revealed over 200 metres of the ore  an exceptional result, said Andrew. We have spent the last two years working on the project as Metampere but have now re-branded to British Lithium as what we are doing will bring huge economic benefits to the country as a whole.\n\nOur aim is to build a quarry and processing plant capable of producing 20,000 tonnes of lithium each year  enough to power 350,000 electric vehicles. The environmental benefits of lithium are enormous and having a major production plant in the UK means not having to reply on current producers like China, South America and Australia. 2019 Global Data Point.\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0November 23, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",St Austell based Lithium company re-brands,https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5XJY-V6T1-F11P-X4BS-00000-00&context=1516831,2019-11-23,1.0

The company formerly traded under the name Fortytwo Data and over the past few years has positioned itself at the forefront of cutting-edge anti-money laundering (AML) and trade compliance solutions by using next-generation technology.  Now named after renowned Scottish mathematician John Napier, the company has built user-friendly solutions that deliver the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in a way that is fully auditable and also transparent to the regulator. \n\n New partnerships, a growing client base and exciting product developments have seen the company evolve into a global force and the name Napier has been chosen to take that message to its clients worldwide.  The man behind the name \xe2\x80\x94 Napier  John Napier was an important mathematician who discovered logarithms in the 1500s. The use of logarithms revolutionised mathematics by introducing a way to save time and limit errors in calculations, and they were adopted quickly by astronomers who were making exciting observations about our solar system.      Napier was rumoured to have said that by \xe2\x80\x9cshortening the labours, one can double the life of the astronomer.\xe2\x80\x9d  That reasoning resonates with the way the company Napier innovates to increase efficiency and minimise risk. Its intelligent compliance solutions are developed in collaboration with academics at top European universities and today, just as John Napier\xe2\x80\x99s logarithms helped astronomers in the 1500s, Napier\xe2\x80\x99s solutions are revolutionising compliance by providing a way to save time and limit errors.  Julian Dixon, CEO of Napier, comments:  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a hugely significant step for us and marks an exciting new dawn for Napier as we grow a British company globally.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur approach is in keeping with John Napier, a true pioneer who redefined the game. Just as he changed the way for astronomy, we are seeking to bring evolution and revolution to compliance and AML by using the very latest technology to improve speed and effectiveness.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe are improving and growing all the time and it is fantastic to be able to start a new year with a new name and vision.

Just 20% of consumers, however, prefer the redesigned logo.\n\nThe new logo features the word ""Facebook"" in all capital letters and alternates between its standard blue, Instagram\'s purple, red, and orange, and WhatsApp\'s green.\n\n""It makes branding consistency difficult and can lead to confusion about the correct way to present the logo in different contexts,"" said Dawson Whitfield, founder of logo design software companyLooka.\n\nPeople want Facebook\'s old standard blue logo back.\n\nPeople Prefer Slack\'s New Logo\n\nNot every 2019 logo redesign was met with negativity: 73% of people like Slack\'s new logo.\n\nThe new, non-hashtag design features a simpler but similar color palette with four quadrants of color. The new logo is also consistent across all of Slack\'s products; Slack used to have different logos for its app and website nameplate, for example.\n\nConsumers agreed with Slack that itsold logo\xc2\xa0was ""simply awful.""\xc2\xa0\n\nPeople Are Split on Yahoo\'s New LogoYahoo has had six different logos since 1996, but consumers are split on its 2019 logo redesign: 58% of people prefer Yahoo\'s old logo.\n\nYahoo kept its logo the same purple color, but its font is lowercase and much denser than before. Consumers are likely indifferent about the minor change, as they have seen several different Yahoo logos.\n\nDespite Yahoo\'s changing logos every couple of years, consumers are 50/50 on its newest one.\n\nPeople Prefer Lord & Taylor\'s New LogoLord & Taylor is the oldest department store in the U.S., but consumers don\'t mind the loss of its old logo. Nearly two-thirds of people (63%) prefer the retailer\'s redesigned logo.\n\nLord and Taylor\'s new logo is modernized, with simple lettering instead of its well-known calligraphy.\n\n""Longtime brands such as Lord & Taylor have had to consider just how hard their cursive or \'calligraphy\' logos can be for users to read on constrained mobile app screens and other online and digital marketing platforms,"" said Baron Hanson, owner and lead consultant at\xc2\xa0RedBaronUSA.\n\nPeople Dislike the New Sears LogoSears experienced its fair share of trouble last year. After closing 175 stores, it redesigned its logo to bring life back to the struggling brand.\n\nAbout 79% of people prefer the old Sears logo to the redesigned one, though. Like Lord & Taylor, Sears tried to modernize its logo with all-lowercase font, though the design has come under fire forresembling Airbnb\'s.\n\nNot every retailer succeeded with modernizing its logo.\n\nVisual Objects surveyed 1,001 consumers across the U.S. to find out their opinions on major logo 2019 redesigns.\n\nRead the full report here:http://visualobjects.com/branding/which-logos-consumers-prefer-after-2019-redesign\n\nFor questions about the survey, reach out to Kristen Herhold at\xc2\xa0232579@email4pr.com\n\nAbout ClutchVisual Objects\xc2\xa0is a portfolio website that showcases work from top creative firms from around the world.

However, there has been some news brewing in the industry that Poco might make a return this year to India. To delve more into this, we will have to look at the launch of the Redmi K30 5G, which has been launched by Xiaomi in China with a dual punch-hole display. This phone is being speculated will come to India as the Poco F2 Lite. It is worth noting that the Redmi K30 5G, is a 5G device meant for China, so when it comes to India, it is likely that the 5G capability of the phone would be dropped. Also, one of the most notable features of the Redmi K30 is the 120 Hz screen. So, why is it that the Redmi K30 is being speculated as the Poco F2 Lite?\n\nPoco F2 Lite and Redmi K30 5G\n\nThe speculation comes because of spotting of the Poco F2 Lite, with model number M1912G7BI on the BIS certification website by 91 mobiles. This listing was made under the Poco name, and the interesting thing to note is that the same model number was used to list the Redmi K30 back in the Redmi smartphone catalogue on the BIS website. For the Chinese variant of the Redmi K30, the model number of the phone is M1912G7BC. The last letter of the model number represents the country in which the phone is being launched in. In this case, it happens to be ""C"" for the Chinese variant. In the case of the Indian variant, the model number of the phone ends with ""I"". Earlier, the device was likely to be launched as the Redmi K30 Indian variant, but now it has been moved under the Poco section. Thus hinting that Poco will revive its series which has not seen any launch for more than a year.\n\nPoco F2 Lite Likely to Pack Snapdragon 765G\n\nThere have been previous leaks as well in the market that hint that the Poco F2 Lite would come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 765G chipset. This further strengthens the doubt that the Redmi K30 5G would be rebranded as the Poco F2 Lite in the Indian market. Of course, the 5G capability will have to be left behind if this phone is to be launched in India given the absence of a 5G network in the country at least for a year or two. But, dropping the 5G capability would allow the brand to reduce the pricing of the phone. But, with all of this being said, the information that is available to us right now is only based on the BIS certification website and should be taken with a pinch of salt.\n\nHints Leading Up to Poco F2\n\nThere are very solid hints now in the market which give us the idea that Poco might soon launch a smartphone in India. A few days back, Xiaomi Global VP, Manu Kumar Jain had tweeted that Poco would be a separate brand from Xiaomi. This means that Poco would finally branch out of Xiaomi as an independent brand. Back in 2019, Alvin Tse, Pocophone head had also shared a tweet which is now deleted. The tweet said, ""You will hear more from Poco in 2020"". These hints, and the increased chatter about the Poco F2, surely point out that the Poco F2 might be around the corner.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 QUALCOMM INC (51%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0QCOM (NASDAQ) (51%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR & RELATED DEVICE MANUFACTURING (51%); NAICS334220 RADIO & TELEVISION BROADCASTING & WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURING (51%); 5G WIRELESS (90%); BRANDING (90%); COMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT MFG (90%); MANUFACTURING (90%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (90%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (90%); WIRELESS INDUSTRY (90%); BROADCASTING INDUSTRY (89%); SEMICONDUCTOR MFG (89%); SEMICONDUCTORS (77%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (77%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (77%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (70%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0NEW DELHI, INDIA (59%); INDIA (95%); CHINA (91%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0January 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Poco F2 Lite Might Launch in India as Rebranded Redmi K30,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=e76f8dc9-c675-4dd4-8fa2-53760c55f824&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5Y1K-02X1-JBYT-H4M8-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=428675&pdteaserkey=sr47&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr47&prid=85644246-f165-4380-9fb3-70de96fb15ec,2020-01-21,0.0

All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0689 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nIslamic Arab Insurance Company, the world's largest Takaful and Re-Takaful provider, today announced that it is re-branding its business as 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company. The company which has a paid up capital of Dhs 1 billion, also unveiled its new corporate identity.\n\nThe intention of the re-branding is to create a strong platform for local, regional and international expansion and to strengthen its position as a leading provider of Islamic insurance and re-insurance products and services. Sheikh Khaled Bin Zayed Al Neheyan, Chairman of 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company said: 'This is the first step in a strategic expansion of the company over the coming few months that will significantly add to our profitability. We will be launching a series of new products and moving into new markets, particularly in Asia and Europe.' The Board of Directors selected 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company brand and corporate identity from four proposals by leading regional and international branding experts. The new brand was created by Lowe & Partners Middle East and North Africa 'The company has ambitious plans to provide Shariah compliant insurance solutions to more people in more countries around the world,' said Dr. Saleh Malaikah, the company's Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. 'In order to appeal to a wider audience and provide an immediate feeling of reassurance, we have adopted the company re-brand as 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company. 'Salama', which means 'to keep safe' or 'safety' in Arabic, connotes a strong sense of security and protection, which is extremely positive for an insurance company. \n\n'The basis of Islamic insurance is the community coming together to secure each other. This was the inspiration behind the new logo design. It depicts two swirls coming together in unison. On another level, it also depicts the community coming together to become stronger and secure each other. 'The baseline is 'Securing our future. together.' which reinforces the concept of Takaful and provides assurance that the whole community is involved in 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company and they're coming together to help each other. Importantly the name, logo and tag line are easy to comprehend anywhere in the world,' added Dr. Malaikah. An established Islamic insurance and reinsurance company, 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company was recently listed on the Dubai Financial Market following an Initial Public Offering, which was many times over subscribed, which helped raise the company capital to One Billion Dirhams. 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company has six Takaful companies and provides services in 70 countries through Tunisia headquartered BEST Re, the world's biggest Islamic 'Retakaful' company. As part of its strategy for future growth, the company intends to invest Dhs 165M in developing its insurance products base in UAE; increase the capital of BEST Re US$55M to US$100M. It is expected that capital enhancement of BEST Re will help Standard & Poors (S& P) improve its BBB 'Good' and A M Best's B++ 'Very Good' ratings. The company plans to establish a Dhs 100M Re-Takaful company in Saudi Arabia and a Dhs 58M Takaful business in Malaysia. Other plans include the incorporation, with a capital of Dhs 200M, of the Islamic Arab Insurance Company, Saudi Arabia, in which 'Salama' Islamic Arab Insurance Company will have a major stake, and investment of Dhs 32M in Egypt to set up a family Takaful company. A further Dhs 20M has been allotted to family Takaful in the UAE and Dhs 11m to incorporate, SOSAR Life, a family Takaful provider in Senegal. Sheikh Khaled said: 'The re-branding of the company reflects our commitment to ensuring that it not only remains, but also strengthens its position as, the world's largest Takaful and Re-Takaful provider. This strategic move will assist us in enhancing our profile in both existing markets and those new markets we have identified as having significant growth potential.'\n\nFor further information: Malcolm Ward, MCS/Action, PO Box 20970, Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

We have, since then, focussed on integrating two large networks, our people and processes. And today, I am delighted to present \'Vi\', a brand that will bring important meaning to the lives of our customers. Indians are optimistic and want to get ahead in life.""\n\nVIL is now leaner and agile, and the deployment of many principles of 5G architecture has helped the company transform into a future-fit, digital network for the changing customer needs, Takkar added.\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla, Chairman of Aditya Birla Group and Vodafone Idea Ltd, said that with the new brand \'Vi\', the company stands committed to partner the government to accelerate India\'s progression towards a digital economy, enabling millions of citizens to connect to the digital revolution and build a better tomorrow.\n\n""As the integration of the two businesses is now complete, it\'s time for a fresh start.

At 12.34 pm, its share price was Rs 12.54, higher by 4.41 per cent from the previous close.\n\nThe rebranding comes at a crucial time when the company is fighting for its survival, amid financial stress and huge AGR dues.\n\nOn Friday, the Board of Directors of Vodafone Idea had approved a proposal to raise up to Rs 25,000 crore through Global Depository Receipts(GDR), American Depository Receipts (ADR), non-convertible debentures, and other routes.\n\nThe development comes after the Supreme Court\'s September 1 verdict on the Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR) issue, wherein the top court gave a 10-year timeline to the telecom companies to repay their dues, with an upfront payment of 10 per cent by March 31, 2021.\n\nMarket analysts have time and again said that Vodafone Idea would require raising of funds and may also need government support for its survival as it is already under financial stress. The AGR dues have further burdened the company.\n\nAccording to an assessment by the Department of Telecommunications, Vodafone Idea owed a total of Rs 58,254 crore. As per the government, the operator now owes balance AGR dues of around Rs 50,399 crore.\n\n(IANS)\n\nRead More:\n\nCOVID19 Pandemic: PVR Defers Major Capital Expenditure Plans\n\nAirtel Introduces New Broadband Plans For Airtel Xstream Bundle, Check Details Here\n\nThe post Vodafone Idea Rebranded As \'Vi\' appeared first on Odisha Television Ltd..\n\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Orissa TV .

Coinciding with the re-brand, the company is launching its new Hospitality Intelligence (H.I.) platform which provides customizable technology solutions optimized for each property.\n\n""Our new identity, Springboard Hospitality, encapsulates our abilities to uncover opportunities, develop innovative solutions, and drive more profit for owners and investors,"" said Chief Executive Officer Ben Rafter. ""When I joined the company in 2016, we set out to infuse our operational success with investments in technology, people and culture. Since that time, I\'m proud that we\'ve steadily grown to over 30 properties in 10 states, and we\'re looking toward continued growth and investments under our revitalized brand.""\n\nLed by tech entrepreneur Ben Rafter, the West Coast-based company embarked on its efforts to revitalize, r-ebrand, and expand in 2018. The opening of a second office in Honolulu allowed the company to focus on the Hawaii region which accounts for seven of 15 properties recently added to the portfolio. Springboard Hospitality additionally has grown its presence in key gateway cities, including Anchorage, Alaska, Honolulu, Los Angeles and Portland, Ore., along with additions in premier leisure destinations, including Sedona, Ariz., Carmel-by-the-Sea, Calif., and Jackson, Wyo.\n\nSpringboard Hospitality has spent years vetting and partnering with leading technology companies to provide tailored solutions to fit each of its property\'s unique operating dynamics. Based on this experience, Springboard is introducing its Hospitality Intelligence (H.I.) platform, which leverages a best-in-class suite of tools and combines it with industry-leading talent, to deliver streamlined operations, personalized guest experiences and maximized revenues. Springboard Hospitality\'s hotels and resorts benefit from H.I. with smarter, more efficient and profitable concepts that provide a defensible competitive advantage.\n\nSpringboard Hospitality has continued growth in 2020 despite COVID-19\'s negative effects on the travel industry, adding three new properties to its portfolio with several others in the works.\n\nPublished by HT Digital Content Services with permission from US Eturbo News.

All Rights Reserved\n\n\n\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0710 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nManchester, U.K. - - Kewill and LeanLogistics today announced that the companies have rebranded as BluJay Solutions. In conjunction with the rebranding, the company has also unveiled the BluJay Global Trade Network, a fundamentally new model that goes beyond automation to help organisations harness the full power of the global supply chain ecosystem.\n\n\n\n""It\'s no longer just about multi-modal, omni-channel and booking tools - we\'re moving toward a new era of business where global trade shifts to the forefront, and supply chain becomes today\'s battleground,"" said Doug Braun, CEO, BluJay Solutions. ""BluJay delivers the expertise, breadth of cloud-based software applications, and end-to-end collaborative visibility that organisations need to make speed a competitive weapon, and optimise their future in the global economy.""\n\n\n\nThe new BluJay Solutions brand reflects the company\'s unique ability to help customers achieve greater velocity of global trade and operate at the speed of business - even in the face of dynamic market forces and fluctuations in customer demand. With more than 40,000 carriers, shippers, forwarders, suppliers, and LSPs, the BluJay Global Trade Network is the largest in the world, creating a powerful network that delivers the benefits of universal connectivity among participants.\n\n\n\n""Our customers\' success is the standard by which we measure our own,"" added Braun. ""The BluJay Global Trade Network exemplifies our commitment to equipping customers with the technology, services and connections they need to deliver exceptional service.""\n\n\n\n""Traditional supply chain solutions focused on optimisation from the point of view of an individual company. But as companies moved to more outsourcing and increasing reliance on global supply chain partners, the traditional software architecture has become increasingly less relevant,"" said Steve Banker, vice president, supply chain management at ARC Advisory Group. ""A modern global trade network model gives companies access to multiple delivery options and carrier choices so they can quickly seize new opportunities and enjoy frictionless and more efficient movement of goods across any border.""\n\n\n\nWith BluJay, organisations can easily manage goods and services across an integrated Global Trade Network; rapidly onboard services, carriers, customers and business units; and actively collaborate with trade participants to expedite trade logistics. BluJay captures all data streaming across the network, so that organisations can analyse and operationalise it to their advantage.\n\n\n\nBluJay Solutions\' rich domain expertise in all areas vital to global trade - transportation, parcel, warehouse, and customs management, as well as freight forwarding and compliance - combined with four decades of experience, make the company a trusted choice of more than 7,500 customers spanning more than 100 countries. BluJay customers include five of the top 10 food and beverage companies, 32 of the top 40 logistics service providers, and 24 of the top 25 freight forwarders. With BluJay, 1.9 billion transportation transactions are processed and 4.5 billion boxes shipped annually.\n\n\n\nIn December, Kewill completed the integration of LeanLogistics, which it acquired in May 2016, bringing together supply chain execution and global trade management in one comprehensive and integrated portfolio of logistics applications, analytics and services - all delivered through a scalable, multi-tenant cloud.\n\n\n\nFor more information about BluJay Solutions and the BluJay Global Trade Network, visit: www.blujaysolutions.com.\n\n\n\nAbout BluJay Solutions\n\n\n\nBluJay Solutions delivers supply chain software and services to the world\'s most progressive retailers, distributors, freight forwarders, manufacturers, and logistics service providers.

In addition, the company has rebranded from Myriteload to Riteload as it begins a period of rapid customer growth.\n\n""We expect our loadboard to be a gamechanger for the trucking space by eliminating freight brokers completely and putting significantly more money into drivers\' and shippers\' pockets,"" said Matthew Kane, founder & CEO. ""We have very aggressive roll-out plans and Justin is the perfect fit to lead this effort. His vast experience in all facets of the trucking industry, and his proven track record building and managing teams make him the ideal executive to cement Riteload\'s position as the innovative leader in the market.""\n\nMr. Kreimer brings 20 years of operations and customer acquisition experience in the transportation space. He joins Riteload from USA Truck where he served as the Vice President of Trucking Operations. Prior, he was the Vice President of Operations at Marten Transport where his responsibilities included management of the dry van division and temperature controlled fleet, as well as regional sales management and facility build out/acquisitions. He also played an instrumental role in the company\'s network development and revenue/EBITDA growth. Prior to his 11 years at Marten, he spent 8 years at Knight Transportation with roles as Director of Sales and Regional Manager. Mr. Kreimer holds BS Degrees in both Logistics and Marketing, each from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\n\nThe company\'s rebrand to Riteload is appropriately timed as it enters a period of aggressive growth. Since inception, the company has built a cult following amongst drivers and shippers, and in its pre-launch phase it created one of the largest pools of small fleet drivers in the space. Customers are excited about Riteload\'s business model that eliminates freight brokers from its loadboard to create a fully transparent marketplace where carriers and shippers connect directly. This direct connection saves money for both sides and creates a more efficient process without a middleman in the way taking exorbitant fees.\n\nThe company has spent the past two years working closely with carriers and shippers to prioritize its technology development with innovative features that are only possible when there is direct, frictionless communication. Example features include:\n\nCarriers:\n\nRiteload\'s iOS and Android apps allow drivers to search for loads, directly negotiate with shippers on rates, and sign contracts right within the mobile app. Carriers set their preferred load criteria and are immediately alerted when a shipper posts a new load that is likely to be a successful match. The geo features built into the apps allow shippers to prepare for arrival and reduce wasted detention times.\n\nShippers:\n\nRiteload\'s shipper platform includes real-time geo tracking that shows the driver\'s location along the route, allowing shippers to plan for pickup and delivery. Shippers see each carrier\'s safety and insurance information as well as shipper inputted performance ratings to make informed decisions on who to contract with. The platform also allows shippers to create pre-set lists of their favorite carriers, which helps build direct relationships and improves load delivery success.\n\nAbout Riteload\n\nRiteload is disrupting the $800B U.S. freight trucking industry with a platform that directly matches shippers with carriers in a fully transparent marketplace. With the only freight matching platform that completely eliminates the brokers, Riteload is able to facilitate the best pricing for both shippers and carriers. The platform\'s logistics tools dramatically reduce truck detention times and empty truck mileage. Riteload puts more money in drivers\' pockets and allows shippers to control their own driver relationships.http://www.riteload.com\n\nSOURCE Riteload\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newswire\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0APPOINTMENTS (93%); EXECUTIVES (91%); PERSONNEL CHANGES (91%); DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION (90%); TRUCKING SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (90%); EMERGING TECHNOLOGY (90%); PRESS RELEASES (90%); SALES MANAGEMENT (89%); BRANDING (89%); SALES & SELLING (89%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT (78%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (78%); CUSTOMER ACQUISITION STRATEGY (76%); TERRITORY MANAGEMENT (76%); PLATFORMS & ISSUES (73%); EBITDA (72%); CUSTOMER RELATIONS (71%); RITELOAD-hires (%); PER Personnel Announcements (%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 USA TRUCK INC (55%);  MARTEN TRANSPORT LTD (55%); Riteload\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0USAK (NASDAQ) (55%); MRTN (NASDAQ) (55%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS484121 GENERAL FREIGHT TRUCKING, LONG-DISTANCE, TRUCKLOAD (55%); SIC4213 TRUCKING EX.

The ""mm"" has no particular meaning although could be read as ""mobile media"", the company says.\n\nWhile many are quick to dismiss name changes as little more than PR fluff or a tool used to cover up corporate messes, much thought and creativity has gone into this particular project.\n\n The O2 brand, the creatives say, signals that mobile phones are as essential as the very air we breathe and, therefore, life itself. Most mobile phone users cite their handset as one of their most vital possessions. The name was not inspired by the O2 shopping centre in North London.\n\n Peter Erskine, mmO2\'s chief executive, said: ""Oxygen is the key thing to life and you don\'t have to teach people to spell it. There were hundreds of names to start with and O2 leapt off the pages fairly early.""\n\n Putting the corporate hyperbole aside, BT Wireless needed a new identity for legal reasons as part of its demerger from BT.\n\n It hired Lambie-Nairn, the branding agency behind the BBC-TV\'s well known hot -air balloon campaign, to help it out. BT Wireless stressed that it was ""frugal"" with its budget and spent less than pounds 1m.\n\nNevertheless, no stone was left unturned: internet Web site names were snapped up ahead of the launch - a detail often overlooked in the rebranding process. The www.O2.com site itself was bought from Oxygen Media, the cable television business co-founded by US chat-show host Oprah Winfrey.\n\n While many companies have undergone rebranding exercises, few have repositioned a brand - Cellnet in this case - that is already well established in the marketplace.\n\n The company is confident it will work. ""It\'s well recognised and immediately recognisable in the countries where we operate,"" a BT spokesman said. ""It\'s a universal term. We wanted something that was easy, clean and fresh.""\n\n BT Wireless is not the only one in the telecoms sector to shed its skin. Industry consolidation has forced companies to merge, change names and rebrand. Third generation (3G) mobile phone services will launch next year and a new entrant, from Hutchison 3G, is expected on the scene.\n\n Over the weekend, One2One, the mobile phone operator owned by Deutsche Telekom, said it was being rebranded as T-Mobile, the name of the German company\'s wireless operations.\n\n Rebranding emphasises just how important brands have become in a society dominated by labels and how seriously companies take the issue.\n\n Nina Cooper, a brand consultant at Dragon Brands, the consultancy behind the Post Office\'s name change to Consignia, said: ""Sometimes the perspective is that name changes are carried out on a whim. But it\'s never a whim. Senior managers take this very seriously indeed.""\n\n Hutchison 3G is taking no chances. It is relying on Wolff Olins, the brand consultancy that dreamt up the name Orange for Microtel, to work the same magic for its assault on the UK\'s crowded mobile phone market.\n\n Sharon Wheeler, Lambie-Nairn\'s managing director, said: ""Brands are now being measured in a way they haven\'t been measured before. They\'re not seen as a nice accessory, they\'re seen as a valued part of the business.""\n\n Companies have a variety of reasons for implementing an image overhaul. Many, like BT Wireless, are forced into it by legal issues. Accenture, the management consultancy, was born when it split from Andersen, the accountancy firm, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n Food and drinks giant Diageo was created from the merger of Guinness and GrandMet. Consolidation also pushed together Thomson Travel and Preussag to form TUI.\n\n Globalisation is another force that drives companies to reassess their image. It convinced FI Group, a technology company, to change its name to the unpronounceable Xansa.\n\n Other name changes seem purely customer-driven. Blue Ribbon Sports transformed itself into one of the world\'s most successful consumer brands ever in Nike.\n\n For the branding agencies, the process seems fairly scripted. Names must be thought up which have not yet been registered, and those names must be inoffensive, short and memorable and easy to pronounce in the bulk of global languages.\n\n The names also have to be available on the internet - or at least available at a fair price.\n\n ""The most important criteria is will it help you to achieve your business objectives. Will it limit you?"" said John Williamson, who sits on the board of branding firm Wolff Olins.\n\n O2\'s future sales figures will be a good indicator of how successful the exercise has been. ""I think the first test is actually the day it\'s launched with the public reaction,"" Mr Williamson said.\n\n Convincing a company\'s own staff internally is also crucial to the success of the new brand, he said.\n\n ""They have to go out there and feel confident about it because if they don\'t then that can undermine the change right from the beginning,"" said Mr Williamson.\n\n At the end of the day, mobile phones, be they from O2 or any other operator, are clearly not as essential as the air we breathe.\n\n What the whole exercise does show, however, is the increasing importance and power of brands.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0DEMERGERS & SPINOFFS (99%); BRANDING (90%); CONSUMERS (90%); COMPANY NAME CHANGES (76%); STOCK EXCHANGES (75%); EXECUTIVE MOVES (70%); SECURITIES TRADING (70%); EXECUTIVES (68%); INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION (60%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0BT GROUP PLC\xc2\xa0 (97%); \xc2\xa0TELEFONICA O2 EUROPE PLC\xc2\xa0 (95%); \xc2\xa0HUTCHISON 3G UK LTD\xc2\xa0 (58%); BRITISH TELECOM AL SAUDIA\xc2\xa0 (94%); \xc2\xa0MMO2 PLC\xc2\xa0 (91%); \xc2\xa0OXYGEN MEDIA\xc2\xa0 (60%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0BT (NYSE)\xc2\xa0 (97%); \xc2\xa0BT (LSE)\xc2\xa0 (97%); \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0BT.A (LSE)\xc2\xa0 (97%); OOM (NYSE)\xc2\xa0 (91%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS\xc2\xa0 (97%); \xc2\xa0NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS\xc2\xa0 (95%); \xc2\xa0SIC7375 INFORMATION RETRIEVAL SERVICES\xc2\xa0 (95%); \xc2\xa0SIC4813 TELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS, EXCEPT RADIOTELEPHONE\xc2\xa0 (95%); SIC4812 RADIO COMMUNICATIONS;\xc2\xa0 (%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (94%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (94%); MOBILE & CELLULAR TELEPHONES (91%); 3G WIRELESS (90%); BRANDING (90%); MOBILE & CELLULAR COMMUNICATIONS (90%); WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (90%); WIRELESS INDUSTRY (89%); CONSUMER PRODUCTS (78%); MEDIA & TELECOMMUNICATIONS (78%); MOBILE MEDIA (78%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS (78%); TELEPHONE SERVICES (78%); TELEPHONIC EQUIPMENT (78%); STOCK EXCHANGES (75%); RETAILERS (73%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS EQUIPMENT (73%); SECURITIES TRADING (70%); TELEVISION INDUSTRY (67%); TELEVISION TALK SHOWS (67%); BUDGETS (61%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0OPRAH WINFREY (58%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0LONDON, ENGLAND (90%); UNITED KINGDOM (91%); ISLE OF MAN (79%); GERMANY (77%); IRELAND (72%); NETHERLANDS (57%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 4, 2001\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",NEWS ANAYSIS: BT CELLNET MARKS BREAK FROM PARENT BY RENAMING ITSELF AS O2;  REBRANDING WELCOMED BY DESIGN GURUS BUT WILL STAFF AND CONSUMERS BUY THE NEW IMAGE?,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=8363c3f3-c2f6-45b3-8f06-6560c69c80d8&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A43X0-X310-00SH-8471-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8200&pdteaserkey=sr48&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr48&prid=85644246-f165-4380-9fb3-70de96fb15ec,2001-09-04,0.0

The renaming follows on from C&#38;C Group's acquisition of the UK-based on-premise wine distributor Gilbeys in 2018. Bibendum Ireland, formerly Gilbeys, is Ireland's largest wine distributor. In March 2018, after C&#38;C Group purchased the company, Gilbeys partnered with the UK arm to distribute some of Bibendum's portfolio in Ireland. As part of that agreement, Gilbeys took on the name Gilbeys with Bibendum. Sales Director for Bibendum Ireland, Duncan Millar, said: 'The time is right to transition fully to Bibendum Ireland. Our customers are now clear about our proposition and what value and choice we can bring to the market. We are really excited about this change and it reflects our business for the business to grow and flourish over the coming years.' This is the latest name change within the C&#38;C Group. Recently, the group's two core Irish operations, C&#38;C Gleeson and Bulmers, were merged together under the name Bulmers Ireland.

Pharr Company's owner and CEO, Cynthia Pharr Lee, today announced the sale of the agency to Leah Ekmark Williams, APR, effective Nov. 1, 2017. The full service, Dallas-based public relations agency also announced its rebranding as Dala Communications. Upon the sale, Williams will be named president and CEO while Pharr Lee will remain with the agency in the role of chairman for three years. Dala's predecessor agency was founded in 1986 by Pharr Lee, APR, Fellow PRSA, one of the Southwest's leading communications experts. Pharr Lee is also known for spearheading the growth of three of Dallas's largest public relations agencies including The Richards Group/Pharr Cox Communications, C.

Specializing in an array of industries ranging from real estate, construction and engineering to education, health care, finance and professional services firms, Williams and Pharr Lee have served some of the most respected names in business. Together they have established a reputation for helping executives and their companies build leadership in their communities, professions and industries.\n\n\n\n'Cynthia's influence and reputation in the public relations industry and business community is far reaching. I was astounded when she approached me early on in my career to discuss a business partnership and succession planning for the agency,' said Williams. 'I never imagined my first job in PR would evolve into my own agency. I have learned from the best and continue to value Cynthia's counsel as she continues to be involved in the agency as chairman of Dala.'\n\n\n\n'I am very blessed to have such an accomplished entrepreneurial business partner, and it's been great to work with Leah for more than a decade and gain full confidence that her priorities will remain focused on excellent client service while fostering a professional and collegial work environment for our employees,' said Pharr Lee. 'I look forward to continuing to work with Leah and Dala to provide strategic communication services to our clients.'\n\n\n\nDala Communications is taken from the nickname 'Dala,' which refers to the Dalecarlian horse, a cultural symbol of Sweden that also represents a legacy of Swedish entrepreneurship, which is a part of Williams' heritage. Williams' grandfather built a successful photography business after leaving Sweden and arriving in New York City in 1903 via Ellis Island, and her father is also a successful business owner.\n\n\n\nWilliams began at C. Pharr Co. in 2005 and quickly evolved in her leadership role within the agency. She played an integral role in developing and growing the agency's client base by 100 percent within five years. She was also instrumental in building and guiding clients' social media strategy, pairing the right social media tools with strategic public relations and marketing initiatives.\n\n\n\nThe Dala Communications team is comprised of skilled public relations experts whom have fostered a 20-plus-year legacy of trusting relationships with clients, communities, media and other influencers. Dala Communications is certified as a Woman-owned Business Enterprise with the National Women's Enterprise Certification, and as a Historically Underutilized Business (HUB) with the state of Texas.\n\n\n\n###\n\n\n\nAbout Dala Communications\n\nDala Communications (formerly known as C.

The rebrand will integrate three companies - Brite Media Group, Mesmerize Marketing and Clean Zone Marketing - that will all now operate under the Mesmerize moniker.

Gregory Leibert will continue to lead the company as Chief Executive Officer, with Craig Mait as President and Chief Revenue Officer, and Michael Ellis as President and Chief Operating Officer. Leibert and Mait were previously appointed to lead Brite shortly after the company acquired Mesmerize Marketing.\n\n""United under the Mesmerize name, we will emphasize organic growth into new products, venues and networks by continuing to offer a customized approach to connecting clients with consumers. We are also actively looking at opportunities to expand through new partnerships and acquisitions,"" said Leibert. ""An integrated Mesmerize makes it easier for our advertisers and agencies to implement full-service out-of-home media strategies in highly-targeted locations across the country.""\n\n""Mesmerize offers impactful multi-media advertising solutions across best in class out-of-home networks,"" said Mait.

All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0792 words\n\nByline:\xc2\xa0Mike Buzalka\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nNexDine, a fast-growing, privately-held, Massachusetts-based FM Top 50 firm   that has been operating primarily in the corporate dining and private school markets, is now undertaking an expansion into senior dining and healthcare as part of a strategy to adjust to the new realities brought on by the COVID pandemic. To support that strategy, the company has rebranded as NexDine Hospitality Group to emphasize an expanded suite of services for multiple market segments and added two key new executives\xe2\x80\x94Larry Abrams as president/COO and Jackie Harris as Chief Experience Officer, both with long experience in the healthcare and senior dining markets.\n\n\n\nAbrams brings more than 25 years of healthcare, senior living, education and corporate dining leadership to NexDine, having served most recently as COO of FM Top 50 healthcare services management firm HHS Hospitality Services . Previously, he was president of the healthcare, corporate and senior living group for Unidine, also an FM Top 50 firm until its acquisition by Compass Group several years ago.\n\n\n\nHarris has over 30 years of experience in the senior living industry, including having served as CEO of the Intergrace and Trinity senior living communities, and is nationally recognized and respected for expertise in creating a resident-centric model of care.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhile some companies look to retrench as a result of the pandemic and economic contraction, NexDine sees\xe2\x80\x94and is seizing\xe2\x80\x94the opportunity to re-invent the company, enter new markets, and expand the expertise and support we offer our clients across all the markets we serve,"" said CEO David Lanci in a statement announcing the changes.\n\n\n\nIn its most recent Top 50 report, NexDine had indicated that the vast majority of its business came from B&I (76%) and independent/private schools (16%), with behavioral health facilities (3%) and eldercare (2%) contributing minimal revenues. The new strategy looks to build on that, says David Chechik, executive vice president for growth & retention.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe had in the past been approached by healthcare companies and senior living companies to do their dining service, which was great but we wanted to do it the right way, so we\xe2\x80\x99ve been building out the infrastructure, getting in the right people and the technology, which has always been a critical component of our business,"" he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was all teed up prior to COVID, but what it has enabled us to do is to accelerate the expansion. We will be looking at all verticals on a national basis.""\n\n\n\nNexDine had already begun expansion into broader client services with the debut of its Corfinity onsite fitness center management program   just before COVID hit. Those efforts will now be expanded and adapted to meet the needs of clients in multiple segments, including senior living and healthcare.\n\n\n\nAs for the company\xe2\x80\x99s traditional markets, Chechik notes that the private/independent school portion of the K-12 market has generally been more receptive to re-opening for in-person instruction, although onsite dining services have to be significantly adjusted to conform to social distancing and other restrictions.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven on the B&I side, [onsite dining] is never going to go away for us,"" he adds, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what we\xe2\x80\x99re finding is that while more and more of our clients are opening up, the structure and scope of the services is being modified because as companies come back on-line, they are not coming back 100% from day one. Many are doing these phased-in approaches, which we see as an opportunity to reposition the business.""\n\n\n\nHe notes that NexDine already has technology solutions such as mobile order capability that could be leveraged in the current environment. Previously, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get as much traffic because many customers still preferred to go in person to a servery and \xe2\x80\x9cbe romanced by the food. We might have had 3% adoption [of mobile ordering] prior to COVID, but now it\xe2\x80\x99s well over 50 or 60%, and the great thing is that customers are already familiar with it, so we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have to create the wheel, the wheel was already there.""\n\n\n\nThe emphasis will also be on customer experience. Checkik outlines it as the distinction between getting a coffee at a Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts drive-up window and the engagement with a barista at a Starbucks counter.\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re creating an experience instead of a transactional [event] and that\xe2\x80\x99s a key reason we brought Jackie on board\xe2\x80\x94to lead that initiative, both internally for us as an organization as we go out to all of our clients, but also as a consulting service."" He notes that Harris\xe2\x80\x99 experience with resident-centric models of care is especially valuable because the senior living segment requires more attention to customer engagement than most others as residents often rely on mealtimes for needed socialization.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Magazine\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0EXECUTIVES (91%); COMPANY LISTS & RANKINGS (90%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (90%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (90%); REBRANDING (90%); SENIOR HOUSING (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); EMPLOYMENT HISTORY (78%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (77%); CUSTOMER SERVICE (76%); HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (76%); PANDEMICS (76%); BUSINESS EXPANSION (72%); BRANDING (71%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (71%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (62%); PHYSICAL FITNESS (62%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0HEALTH CARE (90%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (90%); REBRANDING (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (78%); EDUCATIONAL SERVICES (78%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (77%); MARKET SEGMENTATION (77%); VERTICAL MARKETS (77%); HOSPITALITY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (76%); RESTAURANTS (74%); BRANDING (71%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0MASSACHUSETTS, USA (79%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 25, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'","NexDine rebrands, expands and diversifies",https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=cf7dce66-35ab-42ba-a6ea-bad992a6cfc4&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60XG-NYX1-JBKS-P4BX-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=337391&pdteaserkey=sr67&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr67&prid=1c983520-4d60-42a5-9ba3-349a06c977e3,2020-09-25,1.0

Trustees on Tuesday approved a $60,000 agreement with Business Districts Inc., a Forest Park-based firm that will assist the village in developing a branding and marketing plan. Those efforts could include a new logo or tagline, social media strategies, a redesigned website and other methods for highlighting the benefits of living and working in the village, Economic Development Director Patrick Burke said. \n\n""There are so many communities out there, (so) how do we get our message out there better? How do we let people know what\'s going on in Carpentersville?"" he said. ""I think it\'s good to have fresh eyes take a look at what\'s going on and lead us through the process."" For years, the business development commission has been discussing possible steps for correcting a common misperception of Carpentersville as a crime-ridden town, said Trustee Paul Humpfer, the commission\'s chairman. The rebranding initiative aims to improve the village\'s reputation by focusing on its positive qualities, he said, pointing to a significantly diminished gang problem and a flux of recent economic activity. With help from a village task force, Business Districts will first seek community feedback through surveys of residents, business owners, staff and other stakeholders. The company is also expected to review the village\'s current marketing strategies, conduct a communications audit and hold various workshops throughout the next six months, according to its proposal. The outcome will be a community marketing plan that Business Districts would then help set in motion, Burke said. The company has provided similar branding services to towns such as Oswego, Warrenville and Oak Forest. Officials hope to gather honest input from community members from all areas of the village who represent all demographics, Humpfer said. The results will help the firm develop a rebranding campaign that could attract new residents and businesses to Carpentersville, he said. ""The goal is to find out what people perceive about our village and then act on that information,"" Humpfer said. ""It\'s a good proposal. I think we\'re in good shape.""\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nRick West/rwest@dailyherald.com The village of Carpentersville wants to develop Old Town and the riverfront in the next three to five years.

One company, though, has decided it wants to be more than just a chatbot company, but instead be an all consuming automation suite for the enterprise. That would be Capacity, formerly known as Jane.ai. Launched in 2017, Jane.ai developed anAI-powered work assistant that can easily answer employee questions about their work environment by giving them easy access to company information. \n\nOn Wednesday, the company announced that it is officially rebranding to the new name along with a slew of new features and services. ""When we started the company back in January 2017, we really focused with our messaging, as well as what we were doing on the chatbot itself, like a chatbot for the workplace, a digital team member. Since then, we\'ve doubled down on that, and that\'s definitely a big part of what we\'re doing, but we\'ve built out an underlying platform that goes beyond the chat to do things like private conversations and integrating with your key apps and minding your documents. So, we wanted a name that would reflect the expansion of what we\'re doing into a platform rather than just a website chatbot,""David Karandish[3], founder and CEO of Capacity, told me in an interview. ""The other thing is we wanted the name to represent was not what we are, but what we do for clients. This idea of helping to re-up our client\'s capacity, to help them do their best work, that was a big impetus for the name change."" The company now defines itself as a ""knowledge sharing platform,"" as opposed to a chatbot company, withfeatures that include Enterprise Search, which allows companies to integrate with over 50 apps; a Developer Platform to connect Capacity to custom and proprietary applications; LiveDocs, which allows it tomine information from documents spreadsheets, and webpages; Knowledge Base, which letsCapacitycapture the expertise within an organization, such as who the organization\'s experts are; Conversations, which creates a conversational workflow for questions that require complex answers; and CoPilot Console, which has a helpdesk interface combines machine learning with a human. ""The way we think about it is, your company intelligence lives in three places: your apps, your documents and the knowledge of your team, and how that affects your company is you end up in situations where your help desk gets overwhelmed and your processes become really painful to manage,"" Karandish said. ""The way we built out the architecture of the company is that we\'ve got app integrations so that Capacity can talk to all of your major cloud-based apps, and then with our dev platform you connect any third party system to it, as long as you have a public API. We\'ve got some document mining technology that can mine the questions and answers out of a document and then put them into a knowledge base. And then we\'ve got a knowledge base for anything that doesn\'t live in an app or a document, where we want to pull the expertise of your team and not only know the answer to a question, but know who can help me with these various questions."" The company\'s goal is to automate all of its clients workflows, including customer onboarding and internal training, as well asindustry-specific types of processes, like automating the loan process for a mortgage company. ""We want Capacity to power the things that people have had to do over and over again, and to do so in an automated fashion, so we free up people to go do the things that people do really well."" As for the Jane name, going forward it will no longer be the default for Capacity\'s chatbot engine; instead, companies that use Capacity will be allowed to name their chatbot whatever they want in order to better reflect their own company\'s brand. ""So many of our clients have wanted the bot to reflect their own company, so we already have clients today that renamed Jane into Jessica or Peyton or Abbot. What we\'re doing is we\'re really moving the bot to also be named Capacity, but then letting our clients effectively white label and let the bot reflect the culture of the company. We have some clients that are very suit and tie, we have some clients that are more flips and jeans, so rather than trying to create one persona internal and customer facing that reflects everyone we\'re saying, \'Let\'s give you the platform, you go build out whatever persona you\'d like\',"" saidKarandish. ""We may have a clients that like the name Jane, and we\'re totally fine with that, but we\'ve got so many people who wanted to call the bot whatever they wanted, we wanted to open that up and not be too restrictive on that."" Capacity, which has now beenin business for two and a half years, and on the market for 18 months, currently has a couple dozen customers, all of which pay on a SaaS basis. The company is able to give them ROI in terms ofboth dollars saved, as well as improvements in overall satisfaction. For example, one company it is working withimplemented thje solution around their HR benefits process and they, on their own numbers, estimated that they would save about $168,000 just by rolling Capacity out to their next HR benefits enrollment, which will happen in September or October of next year. That kind of potential savings is why Karandish believes that now is the right time for companies to start implementing their AI strategies. ""A lot of companies have been dipping their toe in the water, starting to explore what digital transformation looks like. What does it look like to bring your first AI platform into the workplace? We\'re seeing such great results from what we\'re doing, and I just want to reiterate to folks that now is the time to start making these investments, because once you get started our platform continues to build and build on top of its own data. It\'s always a good time to start, now is the time to start making these AI investments in your company,"" he sasid. In addition to the rebranding, the company also announced a new funding raise, adding another $13.2 million to its coffers. Theoversubscribed Series B Funding round came from a Midwest network of private and angel investors, including Rice Park Capital Management LP. This round brings its total funding to $23.2 million. The new funding will be used, in part, to continue to build out the Capacity team, specifically adding engineers, as well as sales and marketing. The 65 person company plans to roughly double over the next two years. It will also be used to continue to build out the platform, withupdates to its guided conversations platform, updates to its workflows, a help desk revamp of its co-pilot console, as well as new features, such asimplementing live chat directly into the platform, so a person can ask Capacity a question and, if Capacity doesn\'t know the answer, a live agent is brought in. ""If you ask me, \'What are you most excited about?\' I think it\'s putting the pieces of the puzzle together. It\'s joining these parts, the enterprise search on the apps, the document mining in the cloud drives, the knowledge space, the help desk and the workflows. We are joining them all together in an integrated automation suite where you ask your question and you don\'t have to care where the answer is because we\'re a system of engagement that\'s able to bring you a response, regardless of where the answer is, the complexity of the answer, if it\'s a who question, a what question, a where question, you name it,"" saidKarandish. Now that the company is rebranding and expanding its product suite, the goal, he said, is to become ""the must-have platform that any business runs their business off of."" ""If you think of Microsoft Office as the productivity suite, and you think of Adobe\'s Creative Cloud as the creative suite, I want people to look at Capacity as the automation suite that helps people go do their best work. I want it to be something where we\'re adding so much value to our clients that people start to ask in job interviews, \'Is this a Capacity driven company?

The new name, along with new branding and visual identity, reflect the Companys continued commitment to lead the cleantech industry as the developer of products, solutions and business models that accelerate the global transition to a clean transportation sector.\n\nThe rebranding comes as the Company continues to meet the growing demand from governments and companies seeking to ensure their EV charging capabilities are scalable, robust and costeffective, as well as easy to use and install.

No matter the vehicle type, charging infrastructure will be essential across all sectors globally, and millions of EV chargers will be needed, said Beam Global CEO Desmond Wheatley. Governments and enterprises are eager to provide charging infrastructure that is scalable, reliable and cost effective while avoiding hurdles like lengthy construction and electrical projects that are typical of grid-connected charging units. Beam continues to meet these needs  while securing our energy supply and supporting global climate commitments. Starting today, we are thrilled to lead the world to clean mobility as Beam Global.\n\nThe Companys brand name and visual identity have been updated to convey its mission to lead the world to clean mobility. Drawing connections to beams of energy, sunlight and steel, the new visual language emphasizes sustainability and strength. The debut of the Beam Global brand will be accompanied by the launch of the Companys new website and a change in its Nasdaq ticker symbol (Nasdaq: BEEM, BEEMW).\n\nAbout Beam Global\n\nBeam Global produces innovative, sustainable technology for electric vehicle (EV) charging, outdoor media, and energy security, without the construction, disruption, and costs of grid-tied solutions.

""The branding and colours are coming.""\n\nThe nine-team Vancouver Island Junior B Hockey League is expected to start on Oct. 2. Teams will be broken into three cohorts of four, three, and two teams. Saanich will likely start in a cohort with the Westshore Wolves and Kerry Park Islanders.\n\nREAD MORE: Saanich junior hockey team drops \'Braves\' name\n\n""After a few weeks we\'ll have a 14-day break and then switch to another cohort but right now we\'re hoping things will eventually open up,"" Kelly said. ""Otherwise we\'re just waiting and seeing.""\n\nThe decision to change the name actually started with the Saanich ownership group of Kelly and Ed Geric of Mike Geric Construction a few years ago.\n\nThey announced the Braves name and logo would be abandoned in the spring amid civil unrest for equity in the United States and protests in Canada.\n\nThe club shortlisted to three names, the Defenders, Squid and Predators. What many might not realize is that Predators carried a history as a minor hockey name in Victoria dating back 20 years.\n\nOf course, the most significant tie between the Saanich name and the NHL Predators, the team Saanich is borrowing the name from, is Matt Irwin. The eight-year NHLer with the Anaheim Ducks played a full season for Saanich in 2004-05 before graduating to Nanaimo Clippers and the NCAA.\n\nBut Kelly never spoke to Irwin about the Predators name, he said.\n\n""We had overwhelming texts and emails on the Predators from fans, from parents of players, and from players and ex-players,"" Kelly said. ""People are buying into it and are very excited about it.""\n\nBack in 2002 when Kelly\'s son Bryan was 14 years old, he wanted to play a tournament season for spring hockey and, with Geric\'s son Adam, then 13, the two boys arranged it the first year, he said.\n\n""We had two bantam-level spring teams for four years that used the predators jersey,"" Kelly said. ""Players came from all over the Island.""\n\nFor the first year, there was only one set of Victoria Predators home and away uniforms and the teams would have to swap them back and forth. The spring elite teams practised out of Fuller Lake and entered high-end elite tournaments coached by Geric and Kelly, specifically the Challenge Cup in Vancouver, an international AAA showcase for elite talent.\n\nSeveral alumni from those four years were drafted into the NHL including Taylor Ellington (Vancouver Canucks, 2007) and the late Mitch Fadden (Tampa Bay Lightning, 2007) who died in 2017.\n\nREAD ALSO: Smokin\' summer for former Saanich Braves NHL alum\n\nProtocols around COVID-19 are allowing hockey but are making organizing this year\'s Predators roster complicated for head coach Brent Polischuk, Kelly explained. Ice time is already limited with Saanich\'s Gold rink out of service until late spring at the Predators\' home &#x26;#8211; Pearkes Arena. The team practices on the Green rink and in the Wurtele rink at the CFB Esquimalt.\n\nGames are at Pearkes but are not open to fans.\n\n""Pearkes rink is capped to 50 people, so once each team has its players, coaches, the refs, the time-box and video staff inside, a rink attendant locks the doors,"" Kelly said.\n\nThe other wrinkle is the annual ritual of holding roster spots for players who return from junior A camp.\n\n""If they return they\'ll have to isolate for 14 days before they can play for the Predators,"" Kelly said.\n\nPlayers will wear masks on the bench that come up from the neck.\n\n""We told them, if you want to play hockey, take it serious,"" Kelly said. ""If you want to go to parties, you\'re going to risk everyone on the team, so our guys are taking it pretty seriously.""\n\nreporter@oakbaynews.com\n\n\xc3\x82\xc2\xa0\n\nDo you have a story tip?

On the heels of this important investment, OVIA is also rebranding the company to Wowzer, Inc. - a more memorable, fun name indicative of the engaging candidate experience the company provides. Wowzer is currently the only video screening company that is backed by a fellow heavyweight in the recruitment industry.\n\nWowzer plans to use the investment to take advantage of the traction they already have and continue to grow the team and the company more aggressively. However, beyond the monetary value of Recruit\'s investment, Wowzer finds the most value in Recruit\'s position in the industry and the experience and counsel they can provide as a strategic partner.\n\n""Video screening will be a key factor in recruitment efforts around the globe,"" said Masumi Minegishi, President & Representative Director, CEO of Recruit Co., Ltd. ""By investing in the technology at Wowzer, we have an important hand in contributing to that trend. We look forward to working with the Wowzer team in further innovating the recruitment process.""\n\nWowzer customers are reducing the number and increasing the quality of in-person interviews, thus giving busy hiring managers time to focus on other responsibilities. Wowzer has seen a reduction in times to fill positions by half (from 4 weeks to 2 weeks), and costs savings ranging from 50-80%.\n\n""This investment from Recruit and our rebrand is a very significant milestone for the company,"" said Rodrigo Martinez, CEO and co-founder of Wowzer. ""Having Recruit onboard gives us unprecedented insight into recruitment, while opening doors to help us compete in the recruitment industry globally.""\n\nDCM, an early stage venture capital firm, led Wowzer\'s first funding round. David Chao, co-founder and general partner at DCM, serves on the board of directors at Wowzer and previously worked at Recruit. He also serves on the Board of 51job, China\'s largest HR recruiting services provider.\n\nAbout Wowzer\n\nWowzer is a video screening platform, highly scalable and customizable, enabling both organizations and candidates to create a more human oriented recruitment experience. Wowzer\'s unique platform enables an organization to communicate its strengths, efficiently manage the recruiting process as well as enables a candidate to present his/her strengths in a more personalized manner.

When asked why the company was re-branding, a representative stated that the new name Palm Trading Co. reflects the company\'s goal of expanding their product line above and beyond island watches and offering additional island style products.\n\n\n\nIsland Watch Co. announced today that they are re-branding the company and have changed their name to Palm Trading Co. When asked why the company was changing their name and re-branding, a representative stated that the new name Palm Trading Co. reflects the company\'s goal of expanding their product line above and beyond island watches and offering additional island style products. Dallas Alford, founder, stated ""We felt the new name Palm Trading Co. is a great fit because when you are surrounded by palm trees, that\'s when you know it\'s always island time"".\n\n\n\nPalm Trading Co. was started due to the founder\'s love of the islands, palm trees and ocean. Palm Trading Co. has created a collection of island style watches for like-minded island enthusiasts that allow people to live the island lifestyle and to provide them with a brand that has deep island roots, style and craftsmanship.\n\n\n\nPalm Trading Co. believes that life is a journey and it is just as much about the road you take as it is your final destination. The company\'s roots are deeply embedded in the island lifestyle and their definition of living life is letting your soul shine and your spirit run free. Palm Trading Co. has created a series of wood watches with this philosophy in mind.\n\n\n\nAll of their wooden watches are hand-made from all natural materials with the highest level of craftsmanship and attention to detail. From the different varieties of woods used, colors of the hands & dial, to the detailed logo design, each wooden watch is unique within itself and is sure to please any island enthusiast. Each wooden watch is designed and named after a particular island so that when you wear a Palm Trading Co. timepiece, it\'s always island time!\n\n\n\nPalm Trading Co. is 100% committed to the natural environment that island enthusiasts love so much. They continue to show their commitment, by donating a portion of the proceeds from the sale of each wooden watch to Oceana, a non-profit organization that is focused on preserving the world\'s oceans. Palm Trading Co. founder Dallas Alford says, ""Palm Trading Co. is proud to continue to support Oceana and is 100% committed to restoring our world\'s oceans"".\n\n\n\nPalm Trading Co. believes that with the growing concern for the environment, people feel good knowing they are doing something to contribute to saving the planet, and a Palm Trading Co. wooden watch allows them to do that with island style.\n\n\n\nWhen asked what new product lines Palm Trading Co. plans to offer in the future, Alford commented ""We are expanding our island style watches and will have several new timepieces available in the fall of 2017 and have added some island style hats as everyone needs a good hat. We are also working on introducing some island style wooden sunglasses that should be available in the spring of 2018 so stay tuned.""\n\n\n\nTo view Palm Trading Co,\'s entire collection of island style wooden watches, visit https://www.palmtradingcompany.com.

Colonial is a word that conjures up images that are 200-years-old, said Phil Jefferson, head of sales, U.K. and Europe, in London. With the firm preferring to present itself as a modern, young company, this doesn't give the right image, he added.\n\nFollowing the re-branding, the firm plans to launch funds in Germany and Austria, which will then be followed by France, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Sweden. These are all dynamic fund markets, Jefferson noted. Colonial has further struck up a deal with Dutch firm Insinger de Beaufort Asset Management to distribute its Asia Pacific Fund, through Insinger's Asian fund of funds in the Netherlands, and has notched up a similar agreement in Spain, said Jefferson, declining to name the Spanish firm. Colonial will look to build its presence in the Netherlands through registration of its U.K.-domiciled Open Ended Investment Company (OIEC) at a later stage.\n\nThe firm is planning a number of marketing initiatives, including advertising and road shows, to promote the new brand from September. Colonial will further re-brand its OIEC, to carry the new name. While all 17 subfunds of the OIEC are being registered in Germany, Colonial will offer a selected range in Austria. Here, the firm wants to present itself as more of a niche player, with core competencies in Asia Pacific, health and biotechnology and European small cap funds. Colonial is in discussions with distributors in Germany and Austria, including banks, insurance firms, financial advisors and Internet distributors.(c) Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC This material must be used for the customer's internal business use only and a maximum of ten (10) hard copy print-outs may be made.

The connection between fitness, coffee and the technology company may not be obvious at first, but once you go back in time, you\xe2\x80\x99ll know right away.\n\nPreviously known as Weight Watchers, Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts and Apple Computer, each of the three companies found themselves needing a name change. Apple did it 10 years ago, while WW and Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 are executing on their rebranding.\n\nOn the surface, shortening these companies\xe2\x80\x99 names may seem to be an easy rebranding exercise. But make no mistake about it: rebranding carries a huge risk. Get it wrong, and a company can lose goodwill, market share and much more very quickly. Just ask The Shack.\n\nWith all that risk, why do companies rebrand in the first place? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look.\n\nWhen companies find themselves struggling to stay relevant in the marketplace, many turn to a brand refresh to help guide them to a stronger, more secure future. The reasons are plenty: A change in the company\xe2\x80\x99s focus and direction, an opportunity to improve and/or alter public and customer perception, a way to distinguish themselves in an overcrowded vertical and even a way to attract top talent.\n\nAs an example, let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 Donuts. Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 is on a mission to keep the brand relevant for millennials and the-coming-of-age Gen Z customers who are more health conscious than previous generations. Without a change in messaging to reset the perception that all Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 sells are donuts, Dunkin\xe2\x80\x99 won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to convince the largest demographic that they should still be brand loyal.\n\nIn such cases, rebranding becomes a critical step in keeping pace with changing customer needs.\n\nThe need to rebrand needs to be understood internally as well as externally. If the public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the need for the rebrand, then the rebrand may be received with negative sentiment.\n\nSimilarly, if the need for a rebrand isn\xe2\x80\x99t well-articulated internally, there will be internal resistance to the rebranding effort. Directly or indirectly, a rebrand affects every employee, customer and brand ambassador inside and outside the organization.\n\nExecuting a rebrand is a task that requires literally everyone in the organization to participate in some way. From signage to legal templates to email signatures, there are numerous changes to coordinate across a large number of resources. The timing of the rebrand is just as important because the rebrand needs to be well-executed with a clear message that can be heard and seen across all channels.\n\nRebranding is more than a logo change. At a minimum, a well thought out rebranding project requires creative, PR, internal communications, marketing, sales, technology, product owners, account managers, facilities and administrative participation.\n\nTo successfully execute a rebrand, you will need an enterprise-wide team that includes resources from all parts of the organization. The process begins with research and validation of the new brand name. The validation will include checking public perception as well as confirming availability of the domain name and social media handles.\n\nOnce the validation of the name is done, rebranding boils down to a well-executed name and logo change to communication templates, signage and a variety of marketing and sales assets the company uses. Special consideration should be given to website rebranding because a poorly executed plan can have a major impact on a company\xe2\x80\x99s website traffic.\n\nIn addition to the hard assets that will need to reflect the new brand name, you will also need to plan to communicate the name change using press releases, online and offline advertising spots and other marketing methods.\n\nTo wrap up the rebrand, you will need to enlist the help of every employee to change names on assets they manage. Such assets include phone greetings, voicemail, the company\xe2\x80\x99s phone directory, IVR greetings, employee profiles on LinkedIn and much more.\n\nAs you can see, changing the brand name of an organization is a massive undertaking. However, when done right, you can rest assured that you and your company will get well-deserved publicity out of the effort.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nDocument-Type:\xc2\xa0Online\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (90%); DIRECTORIES (88%); BRAND EQUITY (78%); HOLDING COMPANIES (78%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (78%); DIETING (72%); SALES & SELLING (72%); GENERATION Z (65%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (64%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); BRAND EQUITY (78%); IMAGE MARKETING & ADVERTISING (78%); MARKET SHARE (73%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0February 22, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",How Brands Can Navigate Successfully Through a Rebrand,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=eef4c927-aaa6-40f5-a075-95cbf13945c1&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5V7Y-VMP1-DYRK-H0XW-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=7907&pdteaserkey=sr47&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr47&prid=96b6c7fd-98f1-4596-b3d1-72e36f62cd4a,2019-01-21,0.0

When someone showcases their skills and proves to fellow peers that they belong, you have to accept that. They've earned it.<nl/> It's because of this ideal that\xc2\xa0when we see something that happens catch our attention, even if it feels like we've seen it before, we can't help but pay show it some respect\xc2\xa0After all, game recognizes game.<nl/> While plenty of people\xc2\xa0may find themselves fed up with\xc2\xa0graphic artists continuing to redesign team logos, we're not among them. In fact, we can't help but be impressed with the creativity. Which is why when we came across Addison Foote[2]'s project \xe2\x80\x94 Redesigning all 30 team logos in 30 days \xe2\x80\x94 we were completely blown away. This dude has mad skills.<nl/> Therefore, we thought it was only right to spread the word. All of his designs are pretty sweet, but some of them were absolute game changers. Here's a look at five examples that fit the bill.<nl/><nl/> 1. Cleveland Cavaliers http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Cleveland-Cavaliers-logo-Addison-Foote-Behance.jpg?7abf10 Source: Addison Foote (via Behance)<nl/> According to Foote, this Cleveland Cavaliers[3] logo was based off of the design the team used from 1983-1994[4]. Of course, while the original piece turned the 'V' into a hoop with a ball going through it, this redesign gets even more creative by constructing a free throw line out of the 'A.' If you ask us, that one little change makes a huge difference, and gives this logo some real artistic flare. Who knew Cleveland could feel so hip?<nl/><nl/> 2. Memphis Grizzlies       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Memphis-Grizzlies-logo-Addison-Foote-Behance.jpg?7abf10 Source: Addison Foote (via Behance)<nl/> With this particular redesign, we like how Foote opted to stick with the colors the Memphis Grizzlies have used since 2005[5]. If you ask us, anything before then doesn't really count. However,\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0really makes this logo work has less to do with the roaring bear, and more to do with\xc2\xa0the overall attention to detail. Check out the 'G' (for Grizzlies) in the ear and the 'M' (for Memphis)\xc2\xa0to the left side of the mouth and tell us those aren't sweet additions. You can't, can you?<nl/><nl/> 3. Atlanta Hawks       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Atlanta-Hawks-logo-Addison-Foote-Behance.jpg?7abf10 Source: Addison Foote (via Behance)<nl/> As far as uniform redesigns go, we can't even stomach to look at the new Atlanta Hawks threads[6]. They are an absolute eyesore. If we're going to be forced to endure these monstrosities all season long, the club should at the very least distract us with a sick new logo, and this creation by Foote fits the bill. Not only does he use the primary and secondary colors to depict the lines on a basketball, but he manages to craft the letters 'AH' out of them as well. Sleek, stylish, and hip \xe2\x80\x94 everything the new unis aren't. We approve.<nl/><nl/> 4. Houston Rockets       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Houston-Rockets-logo-Addison-Foote-Behance.jpg?7abf10 Source: Addison Foote (via Behance)<nl/> The beauty in this redesigned Houston Rockets[7] logo is that it encapsulates many cool space themes, while also keeping things fairly simple.\xc2\xa0The basketball at the top is meant to resemble a planet, while the line streaking beneath the word 'Rockets' is intended to represent the Earth's horizon. Like the Rocket itself, this new piece is totally soaring to new heights.<nl/><nl/> 5. San Antonio Spurs       \xc2\xa0    http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/San-Antonio-Spurs-logo-Addison-Foote-Behance.jpg?7abf10 Source: Addison Foote (via Behance)<nl/> Any San Antonio Spurs[8] shield that can effectively utilize the 'Fiesta' logo[9] is an automatic winner in our book. Yet, Foote doesn't just seamlessly incorporate this little gem into his design, he also finds a way to add a major piece of San Antonio history into the fold. Yes, that is the Alamo encompassing the type. What a great touch. Like the place itself, this redesign\xc2\xa0is one we will certainly remember.<nl/> To see Addison Foote's\xc2\xa0complete project of redesigning 30 NBA Logos in 30 Days, click here[10].<nl/> Want more great content like this?

Additionally, the six Walgreens locations that sell Birchbox products will have dedicated bays for grooming products, with Birchbox available at five more Walgreens stores later this Summer. (Other brands coming to these Walgreens locations include Brickell, Journeymen, Oars + Alps and more.)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor Birchbox, as a beauty/grooming retailer, this topic of inclusivity (particularly as it relates to gender, age, race and ethnicity) is top of mind because it is a focus for the industry as a whole, and something that beauty/grooming consumers are demanding across all types of players (retailers, brands, media),\xe2\x80\x9d said Amanda Tolleson, chief customer officer at Birchbox. \xe2\x80\x9cThese types of changes are also about the internal company culture and values as much as the external audience (shaping change rather than just reacting to change). Inclusivity is a topic that our leadership and employees feel passionately about and we\xe2\x80\x99re committed to continuing on a path to more inclusivity beyond what might be asked for from the beauty industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBirchbox first started the transition from BirchboxMan to Birchbox Grooming by renaming the website\xe2\x80\x99s top right navigation bar from \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cbeauty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgrooming\xe2\x80\x9d in April 2018. The move made sense, considering Tolleson said more than 35% of grooming sales are driven by the company\xe2\x80\x99s beauty subscribers. In addition to BirchboxMan\xe2\x80\x99s rebranding, the company worked with Out Magazine to curate the beauty and grooming box for June.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhen our co-founders were brainstorming names for the company nine years ago, one of their criteria from the beginning was that it needed to be something gender-neutral,\xe2\x80\x9d Tolleson said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x98Birchbox\xe2\x80\x99 was always designed to work for anyone, not just women, even though they launched with just beauty (and no immediate plans to add grooming).\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBirchbox originally launched BirchboxMan in 2012, as a subscription service for $20 a month; the company introduced a lower-priced box in 2017 for $10 a month. The box included grooming products, plus more lifestyle items for men such as Field Notes notebooks and Baggu bags. According to Mashable, Birchbox first tested BirchboxMan with a pilot in the 2012 holiday season; the 2,500 limited-edition boxes sold out in three days. That was back in Birchbox\xe2\x80\x99s heyday. In 2016, Birchbox laid off staffers in two different months and the company received a much needed $15 million investment in an attempt to become profitable. In 2018, Viking Global Investors took a majority stake in the company, leaving the company\xe2\x80\x99s former investors with nothing, reported Recode. Now, the company says it has more 2.5 million active customers.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not too surprising that the brand\xe2\x80\x99s moving in this direction. According to data from NPD, a research firm, the skin care category grew by 13% in 2018, and, in another report from Mintel, about 40% of adults 18-22 are interested in gender-netural beauty products. Men\xe2\x80\x99s grooming is evolving into skin care and other categories; becoming a more inclusive brand is in line with trends.\n\nBirchbox isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone in this category; just take a look at Harry\xe2\x80\x99s including the women\xe2\x80\x99s shaving space with Flamingo or Dollar Shave Club branching out to cologne and deodorant. While these formerly male-grooming-dominant brands are expanding, other DTC companies like Glossier are rolling out new lines like Glossier Play, with men front and center in its marketing campaign.\n\nTolleson added that new DTC brands are learning to go gender-neutral from the start.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNewer brands are optimizing for flexibility\xe2\x80\x94they know that they might need to shift and be flexible so they don\xe2\x80\x99t want their brand name to put them in a corner,\xe2\x80\x9d Tolleson said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to build equity in a brand, but also allow it to flex with the business model.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0May 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'","In a Nod to Greater Inclusivity, Birchbox Tries a Non-Binary Rebrand",https://advance.lexis.com/api/document?collection=news&id=urn:contentItem:5W75-DXX1-DYRK-H4B9-00000-00&context=1516831,2019-05-29,1.0

The airport operator said the design was one of the candidates for its new logo but was dropped after consultation with experts.By Jun Ji-hyeIncheon International Airport Corp. (IIAC) is facing criticism over what critics claim is a unilateral plan to change its logo, a move that would cost a considerable amount of money at a time when the airport operator has already been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.Criticism has been amplified after one of the candidates for the new logo was recently leaked on an online bulletin board of the state-run company as well as other online communities. \n\nCritics claim that the new design looked remarkably similar to the logo of Air China or that of the Mir Foundation that was used as a fundraising vehicle by influence peddlers close to ousted President Park Geun-hye.The latest criticism comes on the heels of the IIAC being embroiled in a huge controversy over its decision to grant regular employment status to 1,902 subcontracted security workers in accordance with President Moon Jae-in's election pledge of 'zero irregular jobs' in the public sector. The IIAC said it has spent 80 million won ($66,000) since October last year on work to change its logo in preparation for the 20th anniversary of its opening next year.The controversial candidate for the new logo reportedly symbolizes the Korean Peninsula and a phoenix.According to a petition posted Thursday on a presidential website, IIAC President and CEO Koo Bon-hwan has been unilaterally pushing to change the company's logo to the controversial design despite opposition from employees. 'The logo is a symbol of Incheon International Airport and can be seen as a symbol of the country, but Koo is moving to change it unilaterally without gathering opinions from employees and members of the public,' a petitioner wrote. 'Currently, many employees are expressing their opposition to the move and are posting messages on the company's online board calling for the cancellation of the plan.'The petitioner noted that the logo change will cost a large amount of money as the company needs to change the logo across all its airport facilities. Sohn Hye-won, a design expert and former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, joined the criticism, saying the candidate for the new logo had many problems, saying its use would be very limited. 'Plus, the bird in the logo did not look like phoenix,' she wrote on Facebook, criticizing the IIAC for wasting money.Some critics have raised suspicions that the designer of the controversial logo was a friend of Koo.In response, the IIAC explained the design in question had been a candidate for the new logo, but the company had already decided to drop it after consultations with experts. 'And the designer in question is a design expert recommended by relevant organizations, and not a friend of CEO Koo,' an IIAC official said.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Newspaper\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); PETITIONS (87%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (77%); FUNDRAISING (73%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (73%); TRENDS & EVENTS (73%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (70%); EXECUTIVES (67%); SUBCONTRACTING (66%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (55%); ANNIVERSARIES (50%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 AIR CHINA LTD (56%);  FACEBOOK INC (50%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0AIRC (LSE) (56%); 0753 (HKSE) (56%); FB (NASDAQ) (50%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS481112 SCHEDULED FREIGHT AIR TRANSPORTATION (56%); NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION (56%); SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED (56%); NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (50%); AIRPORTS (99%); AIRLINES (90%); AIRPORT OPERATION (90%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (90%); COMPUTER NETWORKS (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (76%); WEBSITES & PORTALS (76%); SEARCH ENGINES (71%); WEB SEARCH PORTALS (71%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0MOON JAE-IN (79%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0KOREA, REPUBLIC OF (93%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0July 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document""",Incheon airport in hot seat over logo change plan -.docx,,,1.0

A month after its introduction, they dropped to 15% below the previous year. The product came across as thick and creamy, not low fat - and as an 'indoor' brand, says Morrison.\n\n Volumes were finally stabilised through price promotions.\n\n 'The new packaging will push the brand further ahead than it was originally in terms of volume uplift,' says Morrison. 'But it will take a year to 18 months to move significantly.'\n\n Ski - the UK's oldest yoghurt brand - leads the pounds 465m (Mintel) market in volume terms.

We won\'t be buying ""cancelled products"",\' one tweeted.\n\nSince 1946, Uncle Ben\'s products, including its much-loved microwave rice packets, have featured a picture of a well-dressed elderly African-American man - said to be based on a famous head waiter at a Chicago hotel.\n\nMeanwhile, Mars say the name Uncle Ben refers to an African-American rice-grower, famous for the quality of his rice. Defenders of the brand have insisted this history means critics are wrong to associate it with slavery. \n\nEarlier this month - following criticism from anti-racism activists - Mars announced Uncle Ben\'s would be \'evolving\', before announcing the new name today. \n\n\'We listened to our associates and our customers and the time is right to make meaningful changes across society,\' Mars Food global president Fiona Dawson said. \n\n\'When you are making these changes, you are not going to please everyone. But it\'s about doing the right thing, not the easy thing.\'\n\nSeveral companies have retired supposedly racial imagery from their branding in recent months in a ripple effect from the Black Lives Matters protests over the police killing of George Floyd and other African Americans.\n\nQuaker Oats announced in June that it would drop Aunt Jemima from syrup and pancake packages, responding to claims that the character\'s origins were based the \'mammy,\' a black woman content to serve her white masters. \n\nQuaker said packages without the Aunt Jemima image will start to appear in stores by the end of the year, although the company has not revealed the new logo.\n\nThe owner of Eskimo Pie has also said it will change its name and marketing of the nearly century-old chocolate-covered ice cream bar.\n\nBeyond food brands, the Washington NFL franchise dropped the \'Redskins\' name and Indian head logo amid pressure from sponsors including FedEx, Nike, Pepsi and Bank of America.\n\nGeechie Boy Mill, a family-owned operation in South Carolina that makes locally-grown and milled white grits, is also planning a name change. \n\nGeechie is a dialect spoken mainly by the descendants of African-American slaves who settled on the Ogeechee river in Georgia, according to Merriam-Webster.com.\n\n\'We are in the process of changing our name and have developed a whole new brand. We look forward to sharing it with the public,\' said Greg Johnsman, owner of Geechie Boy Mill.\n\nMars had announced in the summer that the Uncle Ben\'s brand would \'evolve.\'\n\nSince the 1940s, the rice boxes have featured a white-haired Black man, sometimes with a bow tie, an image critics say evokes servitude. Mars has said the face was originally modeled after a Chicago maitre d\' named Frank Brown. In a short-lived 2007 marketing campaign, the company elevated Uncle Ben to chairman of a rice company.\n\nDawson said months of conversations with employees, customer studies and other stakeholders led the company to settle on \'Ben\'s Original. \n\nShe said the company is still deciding on an image to accompany the new name.\n\nMars also announced several other initiatives, including a $2 million investment in culinary scholarships for aspiring Black chefs in partnership with the National Urban League. \n\nIt also is planning a $2.5 million investment in nutritional and education programs for students in Greenville, Mississippi, the majority African-American city where the rice brand has been produced for more than 40 years.\n\nMars said it has set a goal of increasing the ranks of racial minorities in U.S. management positions from 20% to 40%. \n\nThe company did not give a timeframe for reaching that number. \n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 23, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Farewell Uncle Ben: Rice becomes Ben's Original as makers announce re-brand they hope will 'help put an end to racial injustices' in wake of George Floyd killing,https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=c3811323-e84d-4ae3-8016-78fed8d0336e&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A60X1-G051-DY4H-K0YK-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=397135&pdteaserkey=sr28&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr28&prid=67c1ed24-374b-4859-8b80-0ea1604ac5d9,2020-09-23,1.0

As part of the rebrand, the company has launched an enhanced VaaS platform designed to help connected home companies deploy innovative, vision-centric products to consumers.\n\nWith already more than 500,000 users, over 8.2 million video events recorded weekly and a 2015 CES Innovation Award honor for its KODAK Baby Monitoring System, the company has established a leading position in the fast-growing video monitoring and Internet of Things industries. With its newly expanded VaaS platform-the first of its kind-Tend aims to open up its mature technology and platform, making it available to major smart home companies that want to accelerate vision-centric product development. Tend\'s VaaS platform provides companies with access to industry expertise, camera hardware, firmware, apps, vision analytics, live video streaming and cloud storage services to help them rapidly go to market with differentiated products to secure early entrance and product leadership in the Internet of Things.\n\nInternet of Things with Heart(TM)\n\nFounded in 2008 as a way to literally see ""Donk""-childhood cat of founder Herman Yau\'s wife-Tend has evolved to support an ecosystem of simple, user-friendly and accessible, yet powerful, vision-centric products that enable consumers to connect with and keep an eye on those they love.\n\nBy bringing vision-and now people and activity detection, plus analytics-to the connected home, Tend overcomes the shortcomings in conventional remote video monitoring solutions to give people and its integration partners more flexibility, control and options-and brings the heart to the connected home.\n\n""Unlike conventional video monitoring companies, Tend offers a Vision-as-a-Service platform that enables companies to build innovative products that empower consumers with awareness and insight,"" Yau said. ""While video helps people stay connected to their loved ones while away, vision provides expanded awareness and insight into the well-being of their loved ones.

With a new SDK and Web APIs coming soon, connected home companies will be able to accelerate time to market with innovative products that leverage Tend\'s high-performance, reliable, scalable and secure platform.\n\nFor example, a forthcoming Tend-powered front door security system incorporates a connected LED porch light and video doorbell system that alerts homeowners to visitors at their door, and even allows them to converse with the visitor from anywhere via a smartphone app. Building on that platform, imagine a system that learns to discern the type of people who show up at your door, giving more awareness and insight to homeowners.\n\nMeanwhile, the KODAK Baby Monitoring System marries audio monitoring with a Wi-Fi camera, which have traditionally been separate domains, along with an innovative new baby movement and temperature sensor that tracks Baby\'s activity and sleep patterns. This comprehensive solution gives parents real-time remote access to keep tabs on their most precious family members and gather intelligence that provides peace of mind.\n\nBelkin, SingTel and BT have also built integrated video monitoring and home automation solutions on Tend\'s flexible VaaS cloud platform.\n\nTo learn more about Tend and its new unified Vision-as-a-Service platform, visithttp://www.tendinsights.com.\n\nAbout Tend\n\nTend is the world\'s leading Vision-as-a-Service (VaaS) platform for the connected home ecosystem.

Will Mapplebeck learns that re-branding means more than simply changing a logo.\n\nTHE JOURNAL (Newcastle, UK)\n\nApril 5, 2000, Wednesday, Edition 1\n\n\n\n\nCopyright 2000 Newcastle Chronicle & Journal Ltd\n\nSection:\xc2\xa0BUSINESS FOCUS,\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0537 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\nThere\'s nothing like a new company image to clear away the cobwebs and raise your market profile.\n\nBut some company revamps have been more successful than others.\n\nDo you remember British Airways\' short-lived flirtation with decorated tail fins? The multi-coloured designs were supposed to paint the firm as an international operation but the new look incurred the wrath of Lady Thatcher.\n\nSoon after a public haranguing from the former premier BA returned to a more conservative design.\n\nBut despite the occasional PR disaster - BP also attempted an ill-fated image change in the 1980s - re-branding is seen as a good way to announce that your company is stronger, leaner and headed in a different direction.\n\nBut according to Philip Dewhurst, vice president of the Institute of Public Relations, it is about more than just cosmetic change.\n\nHe said: ""A lot of companies make the mistake of thinking re-branding means changing the company logo from pink to blue. The key is to change the actual company first.""\n\nTo Mr Dewhurst changing the managing structure, the firm\'s community activities and its product range are the first steps in any re-branding.\n\nCompanies use re-branding as a statement of change. For example Marks\n\nIt wants its new image to tell customers that the company is changing and it is ready to face new challenges.\n\nBarclays is also altering its corporate logo. It is hoping to update its rather stuffy High Street image by telling consumers that the world needs a big bank and grasping opportunities offered by the internet.\n\nPerhaps the most famous example of a brand revamp was BT\'s change from dark blue dots on a yellow background to the logo featuring the piper.\n\nThe change was supposed to paint BT as a modern de-nationalised communications firm. Out went Busby and in came ET, the extra-terrestrial, and it was a re-branding that paid dividends according to Mr Dewhurst.\n\n""BT is totally different from the old British Telecom. It is customer facing and responsive and its values have changed.""\n\nAnd he is also a fan of the BBC\'s recent image revamp which saw its logo straightened up and simplified.\n\n""The BBC had to change to keep pace with changes in broadcasting. It had to make itself more commercial and their logo had to change to reflect these changes.""\n\nAccording to Mr Dewhurst the old logo would not have worked on the BBC\'s numerous websites and the new one is clearer and easier to reproduce.\n\nWhatever happened to the Midland Bank? Now the Midland is called HSBC [short for Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]. But shoppers hardly blinked over losing one of the High Street\'s best-known names.\n\nThat is testament to the skill of the image makers behind HSBC says Mr Dewhurst.\n\nBut re-branding inevitably means appointing consultants. . .and that can be an expensive and lengthy process.\n\nIt would take Mr Dewhurst\'s firm of PR consultants ""at least a year"" to change the brand-image of a leading FTSE 100 firm.\n\n""It would take that length of time to do it properly. Barclays started two years ago. You have got to spend that time, otherwise it can look as though you have just slapped a new label on an old product,"" he added.\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nCohesive identity: Julie Jobling, head of media relations, with the Arriva logo.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0BRANDING (90%); HOLDING COMPANIES (90%); CONSUMERS (78%); CUSTOMER SERVICE (75%); CONSERVATISM (70%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0HSBC HOLDINGS PLC\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0BRITISH AIRWAYS PLC\xc2\xa0 (58%); HSBC HOLDINGS PLC\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0BRITISH AIRWAYS PLC\xc2\xa0 (58%); \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS\xc2\xa0 (73%)\n\n\n\nOrganization:\xc2\xa0INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC RELATIONS\xc2\xa0 (73%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0HSBC (NYSE)\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0HSBA (LSE)\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0HSB (PAR)\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa00005 (HKSE)\xc2\xa0 (83%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0SIC6021 NATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANKS\xc2\xa0 (83%); \xc2\xa0NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION\xc2\xa0 (58%); \xc2\xa0SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED\xc2\xa0 (58%); BANKING & FINANCE (91%); COMMERCIAL BANKING (91%); BRANDING (90%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES (70%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS (68%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, ENGLAND (92%); UNITED KINGDOM (92%); HONG KONG (79%); ENGLAND (73%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0April 5, 2000\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Spotlight on change of image -;They pay consultants millions to do it and it can take years.

While Raghuvanshi said the company has not been paying to the Singh brothers for the trade name, the rebranding will end the association. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the culmination of the extensive overhaul and strengthening of the governance processes initiated by the reconstituted board in 2018, and is a reinforcement of our efforts to completely disassociate ourselves from the erstwhile promoters of the company. Our association with IHH is a significant alliance in the healthcare industry in India,\xe2\x80\x9d Ravi Rajagopal, chairman, Fortis Healthcare said in a statement.\n\nThe Parkway brand belongs to the IHH Group, which operates more than 15,000 licensed beds across 78 hospitals in 10 countries worldwide and is Asia's largest integrated private healthcare provider. Separately, SRL Ltd would seek to develop a new neutral brand name, brand and logo, unrelated to the IHH Group and the Fortis brand, for use in the diagnostics business, it further said.

The company will leverage the combined portfolio of content created by last year's merger of Viacom and CBS.Now known as CBS All Access, the subscription-based streaming service will be rebranded Paramount+, after ViacomCBS's Paramount movie studio. ViacomCBS will rebrand its existing CBS All Access product in Canada in 2021.Paramount+ will feature programs from the ViacomCBS portfolio, spanning broadcast television, news, sports and entertainment brands. The company will also bring Paramount+ to international markets with an initial debut in Australia, Latin America and the Nordics in 2021.The company's Australian streamer, 10 All Access, which is tied to its linear channel Network Ten, will also be rebranded as Paramount+ and will air exclusive rights to Showtime and CBS All Access original series as well as Paramount+ originals and shows from CBS Television Studios, Paramount Television Studios, BET, Nickelodeon and MTV. ViacomCBS Inc. Price and Consensus https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/VIAC/price-consensus-chart?icid=chart-VIAC-price-consensus-chartViacomCBS Inc. \n\nprice-consensus-chart[2] | ViacomCBS Inc. Quote[3] Expanding Content Library from CBS: A Key Catalyst The new service will add shows from BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, other Paramount Pictures and ViacomCBS brands in addition to a range of original shows like The Good Fight and Picard that CBS All Access already offers.CBS All Access will relaunch with a slate of original shows exclusive to Paramount+, including Lioness, a spy drama from Yellowstone creator Taylor Sheridan, a revival of BET's comedy-drama The Game, a crime series based on true stories called The Real Criminal Minds and The Offer, a scripted series about the making of the mafia saga The Godfather.Internationally, Paramount+ will be the exclusive home of Showtimes premieres like First Ladies (in which Viola Davis plays Michelle Obama), Halo and American Rust as well as CBS All Access originals including Guilty Party and The Harper House. Growth Prospects Amid Streaming War Solid growth prospects of the streaming market which is expected to reach $184.2 billion by 2027[4], per Grand View Research, have attracted prominent tech and media companies like Apple, AT&#38;T and Disney to the space. This has intensified competition for the likes of Netflix NFLX[5], Amazon and Roku.This year, Comcast's CMCSA[6] NBCUniversal launched Peacock, which has a free ad-supported tier. Peacock has already reached a licensing deal with ViacomCBS to carry select CBS and Showtime series along with Paramount films. Meanwhile, AT&#38;T's WarnerMedia debuted its $15 a month HBO Max service.The launch of Paramount+ is the perfect opportunity for ViacomCBS to attract new users leveraging upon the expanded content library. Markedly, Showtime, the sister streaming service to CBS All Access, will continue to operate separately from Paramount+. Together, the two services had 16.2 million subscribers as of the end of June.Moreover, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also has a thriving free streaming service in Pluto TV, which has more than 26.5 million subscribers in the U.S. and several global territories. ViacomCBS is looking to use the free ad-supported service to attract advertisers and provide target-based ads thereby expanding its advertising revenues. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here[7]Per an IHS Markit report, new advertising video-on-demand (AVOD) rollouts and improved ad-tech are expected to augment U.S. online video advertising revenues[8] to $27 billion in 2023, at a CAGR of 11% between 2018 and 2023.This projection indicates sturdy growth prospects not only for ViacomCBS but also for the likes of Comcast and Fox Corporation FOXA[9] owing to their acquisitions of Xumo and Tubi, respectively.Fox bought Tubi for $440 million in March among other deals to attract users to ad-supported and free streaming platform against subscription-based streaming giants.In December 2019, Comcast bought Xumo that pulls streams from partners like ABC News, Fox Sports and USA Today and comes pre-installed on smart televisions. Xumo has around 10 million monthly active users (MAUs), up from 5.5 million MAUs reported in the spring of 2019.Nonetheless, ViacomCBS is yet to disclose pricing details or specify whether it would show ads to Paramount+ subscribers. We believe that a bundled offering for Paramount+ and Showtime is likely to attract more subscribers on the streaming platform. Currently, CBS All Access costs $5.99 a month with ads and $9.99 a month ad-free. More Stock News: This Is Bigger than the iPhone! It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The new brand includes the agency\'s decision to fully communicate the upfront investment they make in each of their client\'s campaigns.\n\nChuck Hengel, Marketing Architects\' CEO, commented on this decision, ""As we have continued to invest in our TV platform, we have seen tremendous growth in new clients that are disrupting their respective categories and traditional industries by utilizing our model. As the debate over the proper application of television as a key marketing channel continues to grow, we decided it was time to fully share our beliefs in how to use TV to successfully drive business results.""\n\nMarketing Architects has been investing upfront in client campaigns for over 22 years. This includes a full investment in each client\'s creative, conversion, and analytics costs, allowing every element of their TV campaign to be fully integrated and optimized. This model has led to numerous breakthroughs in campaigns and many successful, long-term client relationships.\n\nIt\'s no secret that marketers are fighting an uphill battle when adding television to their marketing equation, and heavy debate exists around the correct way to approach TV. Through this rebrand, Marketing Architects is taking a stand to communicate the necessity of looking at the larger effects of TV. This stems from their core belief of approaching TV marketing as its own beast, separate from the way marketers think of investing in and measuring their digital spend.\n\n""We do not measure TV success for our clients on an immediate performance basis only,"" said Hengel. ""Instead, we look at TV as a full-funnel marketing channel, where the real value comes from building a brand and achieving major business results such as raising stock price, increasing brand recall, improving customer loyalty, raising capital, and more.""\n\nHengel added, ""This rebrand positions Marketing Architects as an agency focused on helping companies reach major milestones using TV. Our clients\' sustained success is proof of this positioning, and we look forward to continuing to improve our offering and staying focused on our mission to deliver these results through TV.""\n\nThe rebranding includes a new company website that reflects the new positioning, a simplified logo, updated imagery that seeks to represent the power of TV as both a performance and brand-building channel, and updated communications to share business results with the marketing industry.\n\nAbout Marketing Architects\n\nMarketing Architects is an advertising agency with a 22-year history of helping companies reach major milestones. By investing our own capital into each TV campaign, we disrupt the high costs and low accountability of traditional agencies to move performance brands forward and company growth upward.

Broadview itself was later acquired by Tyco International and merged with ADT.\n\nDespite its nearly nine-year absence from the industry, Jeff Gardner, MONI\'s President and CEO, says that the Brink\'s brand still has a lot of cache among consumers, trailing only ADT as the most recognized name in home security.\n\n""Our business has really changed a lot in the last few years with some really big brands coming into the market,"" Gardner says. ""We\'ve always coveted the Brink\'s brand. Brink\'s has been around for 150 years and it still has fairly high brand awareness in the security space.""\n\nAlthough the company went through a rebrand as recently as 2016 - transitioning from the former Monitronics to what is now MONI Smart Security - and was doing well and continuing to grow, Gardner says becoming BRINKS Home Security puts them into the ""big leagues"" much faster at what he believes is a crucial time in the industry.\n\n""It is really going to allow us to improve our growth profile. We\'re going to roll this brand out in the second quarter and we think it\'s going to mean higher brand awareness, which means we will get more leads into our sales funnel,"" he adds. ""We still have to explain a lot what MONI and LiveWatch are to customers as they are not household names.""\n\nIn addition, Gardner says that combining MONI and LiveWatch under a single brand will make them a much stronger company and a better partner for their dealers moving forward. Currently, 65 percent of the company\'s business comes from its dealer base, which Gardner says is excited about the move. ""The number one obstacle they deal with every day is selling against ADT\'s brand awareness and this puts us right in the game,"" he says.\n\nAnd while the company\'s dealers will likely see increased sales as a result of the rebrand, the company expects its\' direct-to-consumer sales will also accelerate.\n\n""LiveWatch has been doing very, very well with a brand which, in its own right, has improved consumer awareness but is still very low... and doesn\'t even come close to Brink\'s. Having that brand, when they call a customer they don\'t have to spend a few minutes explaining what LiveWatch is,"" Gardner says. ""People are going to know what Brink\'s is and so we really believe that the efficiency of our marketing engine, which is a lot about digital marketing and direct response television (ads), will improve greatly. If we have just a modest improvement in the number of leads that we get and in the closing rate we see from our sales people, this will turn out to be a slam dunk investment.""\n\nWhile the company\'s goal in renaming itself as MONI Smart Security was to convey the fact that they were focused on the evolution from traditional burglar and fire alarm monitoring to newer, more advanced smart home technology, Gardner doesn\'t believe that the transition to Brink\'s will hinder that effort one bit. On the contrary, he thinks it will only enhance it.\n\n""This is much more than a name change for us. We\'re going to be rolling out an entire new merchandising approach to the business that will be heavily focused on smart home products and they will be featured more predominantly in our product advertising,"" Gardner explains. ""We\'re still working how we go to market with the Brink\'s brand - we will be making more announcements on that over the next couple of weeks - but we think there is a huge opportunity for us, given what we\'ve done in the smart home category, to really use the Brink\'s brand to accentuate that and make us a strong number two player in the space.""\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, MONI will have exclusive use of the BRINKS and BRINKS Home Security trademarks related to the residential smart home and home security categories in the U.S and Canada.\xc2\xa0MONI will pay Brink\'s customary licensing fees and minimum and growth-based royalties that will increase overtime as the BRINKS Home Security brand is reintroduced.\n\nMONI said it expects to pay first-year royalties of approximately $5 million. The agreement provides for an initial term of seven years and, subject to certain conditions, allows for subsequent renewal periods whereby MONI can extend the agreement beyond 20 years.\n\nGardner acknowledges that the company\'s rebranding efforts will take a lot of work but says that it\'s necessary given the investments that other brand name companies are making in the industry.\n\n""This allows us at a time when brand is so important - remember Amazon, Google, Apple, SimpliSafe, and Ring are all getting into the market and investing a lot of money in brand - and this is going to make us the clear number two across a number of different categories in the space,"" he says.\n\nAbout the Author:\xc2\xa0\n\nJoel Griffin is the Editor-in-Chief of SecurityInfoWatch.com and a veteran security journalist.

If you're falling behind competitors or struggling to reach consumers, tweaking your image can often seem like an attractive remedy. But before your marketing team starts debating catchy slogans or haggling over sleeker logo designs, it's important to know if rebranding is really the best solution to what is ailing your business. If you are set on taking your business in a new direction, it's critical to understand what's involved in the company rebrand process\xe2\x80\x94including the time, effort and resources needed to execute an effective rebranding strategy on your own.What does rebranding mean?\n\nRebranding is the act of cultivating a new perception or identity for your brand in the hearts and minds of your stakeholders. More than just a marketing strategy, rebranding your business may involve a simple or extensive combination of changes designed to influence how consumers, competitors and investors see and feel about your company, including changes to brand name[1], concept, symbol, design and more. A successful rebranding approach may include: Adopting a new name Designing a new brand image Retooling your logo Reframing your products and services Overhauling your marketing strategy And more Pulling off an effective rebrand doesn't necessarily have to involve one or more of the above factors. But no matter the size, scope or type of changes you're looking to make, a robust rebranding strategy should always rest on an adequate foundation of planning, research[2], workforce and budget\xe2\x80\x94resources to note on your rebranding checklist before taking the next step.Why do companies rebrand themselves?Here are the seven top reasons companies rebrand themselves: Negative reputation Bad articles, reviews and press can threaten brand survival[3] and create the need for major change. New leadership Changes in leadership bring with them new opportunities to repair past mistakes and improve perception[4]. Repositioning  Rebranding can help businesses improve appeal among new and existing audiences. Organizational growth  Major events like mergers and acquisitions[5] often go hand-in-hand with brand realignment. Inconsistent identity  A confusing or incomplete identity can create problems only a rebrand can fix. Image refresh Image updates ensure brands stay modern[6], relevant and aligned with what they offer. Market changes Keeping up with changing markets means evolving your brand and adapting when necessary. Whatever the reason, changing your corporate identity is often a critical, if not essential, tool for surviving an unpredictable, ever-shifting marketplace. The right rebranding strategy can restore confidence in and connection with your business, as well as to build the critical competitive advantage needed to achieve your long-term goals. As you prepare your rebranding process checklist, be sure to keep your rebrand rationale clearly in focus. Knowing what spurred on the need for change helps ensure your strategy stays on track and produces the intended effect.How to rebrand a company Successfully rebranding your company requires a firm grasp of your resources, organizational commitment and why you're pursuing a business rebrand in the first place. Once you know what you can commit and what you want to accomplish, you can then customize the rebranding strategy aligned with your corporate vision, mission[7] and long-term objectives. In other words, building a careful rebranding approach involves: Knowing the reason behind your rebrand Understanding your corporate values[8] and mission Crafting a rebrand strategy around organizational principles and goals In-depth research of your position in the marketplace, as well as among competitors Knowing the amount of time, money and personnel to execute your strategy Assembling the team(s) you can trust to reposition your company effectively[9] Rebrands require a high level of buy-in and expertise not just to ensure they're done correctly, but also to avoid potential gaps or mishaps that may expose your business to issues down the road. By building a robust framework right at the start, you're on your way to developing an image that inspires and cultivates positive, meaningful connections with your audience.What to consider when rebrandingThere are many things to consider when putting together your rebranding checklist[10]. Here are ten of the most important:1. Why you're rebranding As we explored earlier, there are numerous reasons you might want to rebrand your business. And knowing what or why you're rebranding is essential to keeping your strategy on point and focused on your long-term goals. Are you rebranding to reach a new audience, or to retain an existing one? Are you building around a new product or service? Or are you merely trying to pivot to keep pace with a changing market and maintain brand relevance[11]? Whatever your motivation, make sure it's front and center as you take on this new endeavor. When you have a clear objective, it's much easier to avoid alienating your stakeholders and work toward meeting your objectives.2. What's working for your competition Knowing what's working and not working for your competitors provides insight into what to avoid[12] and how to stand out. Researching your competition beforehand not only ensures your logo, tagline or name change will be original, but also helps identify any branding pathways that are worn out\xe2\x80\x94as well as rebranding opportunities your competitors might be missing. The research process may also reveal the success or failure of past rebranding efforts taken on by your competitors, allowing you to learn from past mistakes and providing a helpful leg-up in the fight to establish a more dominant brand name.3. Who is your audience It may go without saying, but brand-building is all about messaging to the desired audience. And as a brand-building exercise, successful image reinvention is only possible when you know who your audience is, what they want and how to cultivate a brand that captures their trust and delivers results. A robust rebranding framework isn't built on guesswork or assumption, but on customer interviews[13], statistics and insight that inform and fortify your approach each step of the way. Setting aside time to vet your audience and build accurate customer profiles may seem like busywork, but without it, your strategy will likely miss its mark and fall apart fast.4. What is your mission Your values and mission statement are what anchor your company and put your principles into focus[14]. Unfortunately, they're often placed on the backburner during the rebranding process, creating a disconnect that can damage integrity and force an agonizing and costly reassessment of strategy. Whether your goal is to deliver the area's best tasting tacos or deliver 100% customer satisfaction, your mission is and should be a crucial point of emphasis throughout your company rebrand. Keeping each in alignment helps avoid conflicts in messaging and provide purpose to your efforts. And if you find your rebrand and mission don't mix\xe2\x80\x94but are a big believer in what your new brand will bring\xe2\x80\x94it may be time to reevaluate and adjust your core message to better fit your new approach.5. What is your budget Businesses rebrand all the time and for many reasons. But without the proper level of investment across different communication channels\xe2\x80\x94particularly digital marketing, social platforms and online advertising\xe2\x80\x94it'll be hard to launch that new brand with the force it needs to maximize impact. Ask yourself: what am I budgeted for? Do I have what's needed to make this work? At the very least, a major brand pivot requires a minimum investment in multiple areas to be truly effective. When you factor what you have and what'll need, be sure to consider the commitment of time and labor needed to perform your brand facelift.6. What changes are necessary (and things that can stay)When it comes to rebranding, it's sometimes pretty obvious what is losing traction among your audience\xe2\x80\x94or creating such a hazard as to threaten your company's very existence. For example, all signs could be pointing to an outdated logo[15], irrelevant slogan or inactive social media strategy as a primary target for reinvention, something that not only needs a lot of work, but requires an entirely different approach for bringing it up-to-date and in line with your new strategy. But others\xe2\x80\x94such as a user-unfriendly website[16] or overlooked product flaw\xe2\x80\x94may not be as striking (at least not at first), necessitating a bit more scrutiny before they can be identified and properly dealt with. What's more: it's likely that not everything about your current image needs the full rebranding treatment and would perhaps be better served (and more cost-efficient) as elements of your new approach. The point? When crafting your rebranding strategy, weigh the costs/benefits of changing each element carefully and before you go in at full steam.7. Your design teamDesign is one of those intangibles that sometimes hits the mark and sometimes hits the wall. Still, choosing the wrong design team to update your logo or refresh your website is likely to sink your rebrand before it can swim, forcing a painful reevaluation of your entire effort. Choosing and thoroughly vetting experienced web and brand designers is essential to bringing your rebranding ideas to life. Design provides a critical visual element that triggers and nurtures brand recognition[17] quickly\xe2\x80\x94and the right design team could be the fuel that powers your strategy over the top.8. How your rebranding checklist accounts for ROIWill your rebranding efforts generate enough revenue and shore up enough losses to rationalize what you're putting into it? Do you anticipate the benefits of your new brand to outweigh the costs (money, time, resources) of getting it done successfully? As you strategize your rebrand, analyze the returns it will deliver in terms of attracting new business, strengthening customer loyalty and retaining high-quality staff. Determine what kind of ROI you can expect after implementation and any areas you can improve those numbers before taking the plunge. As with any business strategy, you want to make sure the effort is worth your organization's time.9. How you market your new brand Of course, consumers, competitors and employees know you as you are. But when changes are thrown at them suddenly and without warning\xe2\x80\x94or are unclear and confusing\xe2\x80\x94you're likely to leave them a bad taste[18] that lingers and undercuts your efforts for months or even years to come. How your stakeholders react to your new brand is an important thing to consider when rebranding, as well as what methods you take to prepare them for the news and ensure the smoothest transition possible. Having a good strategy for unveiling your new changes allows you to control the narrative and minimize any potential backlash you may receive for moving in a new direction. Smart, impactful marketing is what eliminates surprises and makes your new image palatable to the public.10. Your next rebrandThere's no way to really tell what the future holds for your company. But chances are that if your organization is healthy and around for any amount of time, you will probably need another rebrand or two in the years ahead. And when that happens, you will be glad you set a sturdy foundation within the rebranding strategy you're executing now. Regardless of what they end up being, anticipating future rebrands provides the mindset needed to make flexibility a core component of your current approach. And by leaving wiggle room within your strategy, you're able to adapt your brand to an ever-changing landscape faster and easier, expediting future efforts and reducing rebrand and marketing costs in the process.To rebrand or not to rebrand: Signs it's time for a change It's not always obvious or easy to tell when it's time for a new brand. But here are a few signs[19] that a brand refresh may be what's needed to pump new life into your business:1. You are indistinct from the competitionStanding out is central to winning customer attention and growing your business. However, sometimes it can begin to feel like you're unable to separate your company from your competitors, as though you're just one drop in a vast industry sea with nowhere or way to set yourself apart. If you're feeling adrift and unable to differentiate your value proposition from those of other businesses, it may be time to rock the boat.2. Your narrative is out of whackAre customers having trouble nailing down who you are and what you do? Do you offer an array of products or services that have no common thread, or are unified by a single brand narrative? Incoherent messaging can do significant damage to your image and brand interaction, signaling the need for redefinition and a unifying rebranding strategy.3. Times have changed. Your brand hasn'tSocietal or market changes happen all the time. But in the information age, trends and cultural norms are shifting at a rapid pace[20]. And if you haven't done anything to adapt or keep up, a new perspective may be in order. Sometimes a logo or name change may be all that is needed to usher an outdated brand into the modern era. Other times, a more comprehensive rebranding checklist and reinvention approach for squaring up with today's consumer[21].4. You've grown into new marketsYour brand may have strong name recognition and roots in a particular market or local area. But plans for growth across a new venue may be a good sign to think about a broader branding strategy. If your local or regional business has recently relocated or expanded outside your immediate customer zone, a few nuanced changes and tweaked marketing approach may be needed to ensure a smoother, more successful transition.5. A negative image is draining your brand reputationBad press has long been the bane of organizations and leaders across the business sector. Factor in the recent explosion and popularity of review sites, social platforms and search results, and that one bad item becomes a virtual nightmare for your brand, creating a crisis that endangers the integrity and survival of your company.

Safe to say we can add that to this season\'s list of When Marketeers Attack along with the Leeds United\'s aborted Gaviscon logo and the cringeworthy Manchester City video to celebrate winning the Premier League.\n\nTo be clear, Bristol owe Steve Lansdown a great deal. Without his backing, the club may have gone under 10 years ago and he has since invested millions more in his aim of taking them into the Champions Cup. He has moved them into a freshly redeveloped stadium at Ashton Gate and is financing a move to a new training ground. The club also run a brilliant community programme and yesterday the squad visited the Children\'s Hospice South West. These are all admirable initiatives.\n\nYet his generosity does not give him the right to unilaterally wipe out a heritage that goes back 130 years without any consultation with supporters, who have been unanimous and vociferous in their opposition to the changes.\n\nNames, strips and emblems matter. They are the glue that binds generations of fans together. As owners, coaches and players come and go, they are what remains constant. The new kit and emblem have zero connection to Bristol as a city or the club\'s past. It is utterly soulless, more akin to a newly formed American MLS franchise than a club with as proud a history as Bristol.\n\nSo why was this been done? According to Lansdown, it was because of the club\'s struggle to compete commercially that has led supporters to jump ship to teams such as Exeter. Yet this is a classic case of putting the cart before the horse. If Bristol lost any fans worth keeping, it was because they have spent eight of the past nine years in the Championship rather than because they lacked an animal in their name. Build a successful team, as Pat Lam may well do, and the marketing looks after itself.\n\nClearly Lansdown is not the first to go down this route. In 2012, Vincent Tan changed Cardiff City\'s strip from blue to red and the emblem from a bluebird to a dragon. This, he believed, would allow the club to tap into the huge Asian market, an area Lansdown has also cited. Three years later, he changed back after realising that, short of making them a Champions League team, no one in Asia would ever care about Cardiff City.\n\nFour years ago, Ben Jeffreys, then a commercial consultant to the Newport Gwent Dragons (since rebranded Dragons) attempted to rebrand the region\'s logo, which unleashed a tsunami of vitriol. Within 24 hours, Jeffreys had backed down.\n\n""In retrospect, the feedback I learnt there is that your identity is something that is fundamental to the club,"" Jeffreys, now the chief executive at Pontypool, said. ""Your history and your heritage are what drive people to come back and when they are in troubled times.""\n\nDespite inviting feedback, Bristol confirmed they will not be changing path.\n\nAll the goodwill fostered by promotion lost in a moment of needless marketing madness.\n\nLansdown\'s generosity does not give him the right to wipe out a heritage of 130 years\n\n\nGraphic\n\n\n\n \n\nGrizzly change: Bristol have a new logo and kits for the Premiership next season\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0April 18, 2018\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'","Marketing rebrand is just not Bristol fashion; Final whistle The bizarre decision to call the promoted club the Bears takes a bite out of tradition, writes Daniel Schofield",https://advance-lexis-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=a22843c3-fbdb-48c3-8db7-a51b9fdcd215&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A5S4D-36B1-DY9P-N0M4-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8109&pdteaserkey=sr51&pditab=allpods&ecomp=tzg2k&earg=sr51&prid=cd8eaadb-35f3-473a-b36c-f339a4207cdd,2018-04-18,1.0

""While retaining its most iconic elements, the contemporary, minimal aesthetic had been created to seamlessly match our forthcoming models.""\n\nSpecific changes to the logo include a move away from the 3-D metallic texture which has been present since 2008, in favour of a flat minimalist design, optimised for the digital age. It also features a sleek, stylish new griffin emblem which, in a confident move from the brand, loses the griffin\'s wing and the word \'Vauxhall\' across the top while retaining the iconic Vauxhall \'V\'. The logo also pairs the brand\'s idiosyncratic bright red colour with a deep blue - underlining Vauxhall\'s heritage as a British Brand since 1903.\n\nThe new logo presents an updated and exciting fresh face to the world and, with its focus on digital optimisation, places Vauxhall at the very forefront of British roads.\n\nBoth the redesigned logo and Vizor grille will feature first on the new Vauxhall Mokka due for release in 2021.\n\nSource: Vauxhall Motors Limited\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Web Publication\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (90%); BRANDING (78%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 VAUXHALL MOTORS LTD (96%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0REBRANDING (90%); BRANDING (78%)\n\n\n\nGeographic:\xc2\xa0UNITED KINGDOM (59%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0September 25, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Vauxhall Motors Introduces New Logo Redesign.docx,,,1.0

(IIAC) is facing criticism over what critics claim is a unilateral plan to change its logo, a move that would cost a considerable amount of money at a time when the airport operator has already been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nCriticism has been amplified after one of the candidates for the new logo was recently leaked on an online bulletin board of the state-run company as well as other online communities.\n\nCritics claim that the new design looked remarkably similar to the logo of Air China or that of the Mir Foundation that was used as a fundraising vehicle by influence peddlers close to ousted President Park Geun-hye.\n\nThe latest criticism comes on the heels of the IIAC being embroiled in a huge controversy over its decision to grant regular employment status to 1,902 subcontracted security workers in accordance with President Moon Jae-in\'s election pledge of ""zero irregular jobs"" in the public sector.\n\nThe IIAC said it has spent 80 million won ($66,000) since October last year on work to change its logo in preparation for the 20th anniversary of its opening next year.\n\nThe controversial candidate for the new logo reportedly symbolizes the Korean Peninsula and a phoenix.\n\nAccording to a petition posted Thursday on a presidential website, IIAC President and CEO Koo Bon-hwan has been unilaterally pushing to change the company\'s logo to the controversial design despite opposition from employees.\n\n""The logo is a symbol of Incheon International Airport and can be seen as a symbol of the country, but Koo is moving to change it unilaterally without gathering opinions from employees and members of the public,"" a petitioner wrote. ""Currently, many employees are expressing their opposition to the move and are posting messages on the company\'s online board calling for the cancellation of the plan.""\n\nThe petitioner noted that the logo change will cost a large amount of money as the company needs to change the logo across all its airport facilities.\n\nSohn Hye-won, a design expert and former lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, joined the criticism, saying the candidate for the new logo had many problems, saying its use would be very limited.\n\n""Plus, the bird in the logo did not look like phoenix,"" she wrote on Facebook, criticizing the IIAC for wasting money.\n\nSome critics have raised suspicions that the designer of the controversial logo was a friend of Koo.\n\nIn response, the IIAC explained the design in question had been a candidate for the new logo, but the company had already decided to drop it after consultations with experts.\n\n""And the designer in question is a design expert recommended by relevant organizations, and not a friend of CEO Koo,"" an IIAC official said. 2020 Global Data Point.\n\nClassification\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage:\xc2\xa0ENGLISH\n\n\n\nPublication-Type:\xc2\xa0Magazine\n\n\n\nJournal Code:\xc2\xa01789\n\n\n\nSubject:\xc2\xa0INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); PETITIONS (88%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (76%); POLITICAL CANDIDATES (76%); FUNDRAISING (75%); EXECUTIVES (74%); TRENDS & EVENTS (74%); STATE OWNED BUSINESSES (73%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (72%); POLITICAL PARTIES (71%); SUBCONTRACTING (68%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (57%); ANNIVERSARIES (51%)\n\n\n\nCompany:\xc2\xa0 AIR CHINA LTD (57%);  FACEBOOK INC (51%)\n\n\n\nTicker:\xc2\xa0AIRC (LSE) (57%); 0753 (HKSE) (57%); FB (NASDAQ) (51%)\n\n\n\nIndustry:\xc2\xa0NAICS481112 SCHEDULED FREIGHT AIR TRANSPORTATION (57%); NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION (57%); SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED (57%); NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING & BROADCASTING & WEB SEARCH PORTALS (51%); AIRPORTS (99%); AIRLINES (90%); COMPUTER NETWORKS (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); WEBSITES & PORTALS (90%); AIRPORT OPERATION (78%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (77%); ELECTRONIC PUBLISHING (77%); SEARCH ENGINES (71%); WEB SEARCH PORTALS (71%)\n\n\n\nPerson:\xc2\xa0MOON JAE-IN (79%); PARK GEUN-HYE (79%)\n\n\n\nLoad-Date:\xc2\xa0July 21, 2020\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Document'",Incheon airport in hot seat over logo change plan -.docx,,,1.0

All Rights Reserved\n\nLength:\xc2\xa0581 words\n\nBody\n\n\n\n\n\nUNIVERSITY PARK, Pa., Jan. 10 -- Pennsylvania State University issued the following news release:\n\nThe negative reaction to Starbucks\' redesigned logo by the company\'s self-described most loyal customers may be attributable to the strong connection Starbucks\' consumers feel toward the brand, according to research co-authored by a professor at Penn State\'s Smeal College of Business.\n\nKaren Winterich, assistant professor of marketing at Smeal, and researchers Michael Walsh of West Virginia University and Vikas Mittal of Rice University recently examined how consumers react to logo redesigns. They found that consumers who are strongly committed to a brand tend to react more negatively toward new logos, while more casual customers typically view the redesigns as a positive development. Further, the negativity felt by the brand\'s best customers can spill over and cause them to have a lower attitude toward the brand.\n\nBrands like Starbucks gain much of their strength from consumers who feel a personal connection to the brand. However, it\'s these same passionate brand fans who react negatively to logo changes, and in the case of Starbucks, took to social networking websites to express their negative feelings about the change.\n\n""Most companies presume that their most precious customers -- those having strong brand commitment -- will be more accommodating to changes,"" the researchers write. ""Our results show this is likely a mistaken assumption -- one that can alienate the core, the most committed of a brand\'s customers.""\n\nTo test their hypothesis, Winterich and her colleagues examined how 632 undergraduate students responded to logo redesigns for Adidas and New Balance athletic shoes. They had a professional graphic designer create two new versions of each brand\'s logo, one slightly modified from the original and the second one considerably more so. Each participant was surveyed about their brand commitment and attitude after viewing the original logo and then again after viewing one of the redesigns.\n\nThey found that brand attitudes decreased for those strongly committed to the brand and increased for the weakly committed. The researchers believe that committed brand enthusiasts view the logo changes as threatening to their relationship with the brand.\n\n""Those with strong brand commitment will see the original brand logo -- and the associations -- as representing themselves and the integral relationship they have with the brand,"" the researchers write. ""They are likely to view a change in the logo, which affects these associations, as threatening their self-brand connections and relationships. Consequently, such consumers will be negatively disposed to the logo change and likely to evaluate the logo negatively.""\n\nWinterich and her co-authors suggest that companies take a nuanced approach to logo redesign. They recommend soliciting input about the redesign from the brand\'s most committed consumers and perhaps even notifying them before the changes are revealed to the broader public. ""Giving the strongly committed such a feeling of being an \'insider\' may strengthen their self-brand connection and mitigate the potentially negative effects of logo redesign,"" they write.\n\nTheir study, ""Do Logo Redesigns Help or Hurt Your Brand? The Role of Brand Commitment,"" was published in 2010 in the Journal of Product & Brand Management.

Neither did football coach June Jones, who pushed for the logo and name change along with agent Leigh Steinberg, who was hired by the school to market the athletics program.\n\n''The university is sorry if anyone was offended. That was not the intent,'' university spokesman Jim Manke said Thursday.\n\nHawaii was known as the Fighting Deans during its first football game in 1909. The name Rainbows was used for the first time by reporters following the final game of the 1923 season, an upset victory over Oregon State after which a rainbow appeared over the field.\n\nThe school's nickname was changed to Rainbow Warriors in the mid-1960s after the student newspaper ridiculed the name Rainbows and linked it to homosexuals.\n\nNow the school may be walking into another minefield by going with just ''Warriors.''\n\nMany college and professional teams including baseball's Cleveland Indians and football's Washington Redskins have been pressured to change their Indian-related names and mascots.\n\nJonathan Osorio, an associate professor at the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies, said he personally has no problem with the name Warriors since it's used by many cultures and isn't specific to one group of people.\n\nBut he said some Hawaiian students believe the nickname improperly co-opts a piece of their culture.\n\n''We feel powerless about how these symbols are used. When they appear as ridiculous or burlesqued images, there's nothing we can do about it,'' said Osorio, a Native Hawaiian. ''It feels like they're making fun of our culture.''\n\n For 77 years, the rainbow has been the symbol and nickname for the University of Hawaii football team, with the rallying cry, ''Go 'Bows!''\n\nMore recently, the rainbow has become a symbol for gay and lesbian pride, which the school's athletic director said was a factor in the decision to drop the rainbow from school logos and the football team's nickname.

''We remain committed to our policies on diversity and inclusiveness.''\n\nFootball coach June Jones did not return phone calls seeking comment. Jones had pushed for the logo and name change along with agent Leigh Steinberg, who was hired by the school to market the athletics program.\n\n''The university is sorry if anyone was offended. That was not the intent,'' university spokesman Jim Manke said Thursday.\n\nHawaii was known as the Fighting Deans during its first football game in 1909. The name Rainbows was used for the first time by reporters following the final game of the 1923 season, an upset victory over Oregon State after which a rainbow appeared over the field.\n\nThe school's nickname was changed to Rainbow Warriors in the mid-1960s after the student newspaper ridiculed the name Rainbows and linked it to homosexuals.\n\nNow the school may be walking into another minefield by going with just ''Warriors.''\n\nMany college and professional teams including baseball's Cleveland Indians and football's Washington Redskins have been pressured to change their Indian-related names and mascots.\n\nJonathan Osorio, an associate professor at the university's Center for Hawaiian Studies, said he personally has no problem with the name Warriors since it's used by many cultures and isn't specific to one group of people.\n\nBut he said some Hawaiian students believe the nickname improperly co-opts a piece of their culture.\n\n''We feel powerless about how these symbols are used. When they appear as ridiculous or burlesqued images, there's nothing we can do about it,'' said Osorio, a Native Hawaiian. ''It feels like they're making fun of our culture.''\n\n For 77 years, the rainbow has been the symbol and nickname for the University of Hawaii football team, with the rallying cry, ''Go 'Bows!''\n\nMore recently, the rainbow has become a symbol for gay and lesbian pride, which the school's athletic director said was a factor in the decision to drop the rainbow from school logos and the football team's nickname. From now on, the team will be know only as the Warriors.\n\n''That logo really put a stigma on our program at times in regards to it's part of the gay community, their flags and so forth,'' Hugh Yoshida said after the new logo was unveiled this week.\n\nNow, the university if being accused of homophobia by gay and lesbian groups and being criticized by some Native Hawaiians.\n\n''A statement like that I can understand coming from student-athletes, but to come from the athletic director, I am surprised and disappointed,'' said Ken Miller of the Gay and Lesbian Community Center.\n\nThe old logo with the letters UH and a rainbow of blue, green, red and yellow was replaced by an ''H'' adorned with Polynesian kapa designs signifying strength and unity.\n\nMiller wants the athletics program to undergo sensitivity training.\n\n''The issue is sensitivity and the fact they would use the gay community as a scapegoat,'' Miller said.\n\nYoshida, who earlier said his comments were taken out of context, issued a statement late Friday apologizing to anyone he may have offended.\n\n''I understand why some people might consider some of the comments to be derogatory, even if no harm was intended,'' he said.

With 20 percent more pages in each issue, and four special, 64-page double issues per year, the new Nation offers even more room for vivid reporting, long-form analysis, and hard-hitting investigations. Nation editor D.D. Guttenplan introduces the redesign and explains the logic and logistics of our new aesthetic in an editor's note today[2]. He writes: Why change the way the magazine looks?\n\n Because our relationship to our readers and to the world we cover has changed. From 1865 until some point in the last decade, The Nation functioned partly as a weekly news magazine\xe2\x80\x94and looked it. We still break important stories, often agenda-setting stories, by award-winning writers. But we do that now every day of the week, on TheNation.com. When we asked print readers what they wanted more of, their answers were clear: more investigative journalism, more political news unavailable elsewhere, and more analysis from The Nation's distinctive progressive perspective. More great stories. More strong arguments. More fearless reporting. With more time between issues to enjoy each print edition of The Nation. So that's what we're going to deliver. The reimagined product offers a clean, crisp, and modern refresh of our print magazine that better serves the kind of journalism our readers want most. It is an investment in The Nation's orientation toward impact\xe2\x80\x94and its commitment to truth-telling. Rising above the frenetic pace of today's news cycle, The Nation's print issue gives pause, grounding, and brings context and history to bear on the present moment. It is also a decision about how people get their news today, what kind of journalism makes sense for which platforms, and how to best reach our growing audiences with the content our readers want\xe2\x80\x94when and how they want it. In the rapid-fire, 24/7 media marketplace with so much breaking news online, including at TheNation.com, many have told us they get their news online and want greater depth in print. And the redesign is unabashedly print. A page feels like a page. The redesign lets long-form, expansive journalism breathe, rather than try to mash the website experience into print. The result is sharp, intentional, and uncluttered. In a world where we consume so much online, there is renewed appreciation for the value of, and affection for, print as a medium: This redesign creates a richer and better experience with that print product. The print redesign was handled in-house by our creative director, Robert Best, and it will inform a digital overhaul in 2021. The redesigned logo, marking the broader redesign, retains the history of the magazine's logo, yet brings it forward: The classic logo type is now layered with a clean modern red square, and there is a strong contrast echoing the past and marking the next chapter. The new look is bold, eye-catching, and leans to the left\xe2\x80\x94all appropriate for The Nation. With 20 percent more pages in each issue, and four double issues per year, the new Nation offers more space to: Do more high-impact investigative stories, spotlighting injustice in action, the causes most deserving of our readers' attention, and the movement-building, organizing and fights-yet-to-be-won across America and around the globe. Experiment, lift up new voices, spotlight creativity in politics as well as the arts, and create the kind of implicit dialogue between writers and subjects that distinguishes a magazine from a website or an aggregator. Comment on the current conversation, showcasing incisive columnists and bold editorials with a signature mix of dispatches and data-driven news. Publish stories that force us to question our assumptions\xe2\x80\x94and stories that give us the hope and strength needed to carry on our struggle. The Nation has long\xe2\x80\x94and uniquely\xe2\x80\x94been a place where radicals and liberals argued with one another. And, lately, where one generation of activists engages with another. Give serious consideration to the literary, artistic, and cultural life of our time\xe2\x80\x94and more space to attend to a wider range of cultural and artistic work, from fashion and theater to online gaming and film. Develop richer and more compelling themed issues, with more depth and more detail, tackling the most pressing debates of today's left landscape. Introduce more foreign reporting, profiles, and analysis. In the inaugural print issue, 'The Drowned and the Saved[3],' a two-part cover story for the first redesigned issue, marks The Nation's signal commitment to one of the most pressing crises of our moment: Why real climate justice is so hard. Daniel Judt reports[4] on Britain's long road to a just transition phasing out fossil fuels; why that isn't a political issue in the UK, and why that's a problem. On the ground from the Bahamas after Hurricane Dorian, the Category 5 monster storm that pummeled the north in September 2019, Sonia Shah witnesses[5] how in the Bahamas, as across the globe, the world has failed the people most vulnerable to climate change. And a searing profile of Mitch McConnell[6], 'the jowly old swamp monster from Washington, D.C.,' by longtime contributor Bob Moser, presents The Nation's signature blend of wit, political acuity, and colorful reporting on one of the most dramatic campaigns of the upcoming election cycle. In addition to regular editorials and commentary from our terrific columnists like Katha Pollitt[7], Elie Mystal[8], Eric Alterman[9], and Kali Holloway[10], new regular front-of-book rubrics will offer fresh ways to engage with, provoke, and galvanize our readership: 'The Argument[11]' offers a concise, occasionally contrarian, always pointed case for or against a pressing issue of public importance. 'The Leak[12]' makes space to showcase and decode the leaks and FOIA'ed documents obtained by our DC bureau\xe2\x80\x94and translate them into plain English. 'Dateline' and 'Postcards' will feature dispatches from the places across the country\xe2\x80\x94and around the world\xe2\x80\x94that we think you need to hear from. And 'The Debate' will host a rigorous, rotating cast of contributors weighing in on opposite sides of propositions roiling the progressive community. And, finally, in 'Books and the Arts[13],' the freshly redesigned magazine will feature even more pages of essay-reviews and criticism from some of the country's leading intellectuals, novelists, academics, and critics. Ever since the 'back of the book' was inaugurated, it has been home to writers tackling some of the most pressing questions of the day\xe2\x80\x94whether relating to American democracy or contemporary literature\xe2\x80\x94and the magazine will now feature an expanded section, full of even more cultural commentary and intellectual debate. This week's issue features Adom Getachew on Orlando Patterson[14] and the postcolonial predicament and Michael Kazin on the ever-present thorn in our democratic side[15]: Will we ever get rid of the electoral college? The forthcoming Fall Books special issue will feature Randall Kennedy, Manisha Sinha, Elias Rodriques, Anya Schiffrin, Lovia Gyarkye, Jeet Heer, and Charlie Savage. Nation editor D.D. Guttenplan and Robert Best, the creative director who shepherded the redesign to fruition, are available for select interviews.
